"""The by-contract projection of the :mod:`~.DIA_US_SEC` model.

The Space is parameterized by ``point_id``, so ``Projection[19]`` is an ItemSpace
projecting model point 19, the worked-example anchor cell in force 241 months at the
valuation date, one month into its income phase::

    >>> Projection[19].result_cf()         # one row per month from the valuation date
    >>> Projection[19].result_pols()       # the counts and survival behind it
    >>> Projection[1].result_annual()      # the worked example, issued at t = 0
    >>> Projection.point_id = 8            # or switch the default

Switch the default, or set any Reference, before the model computes anything.

This is :mod:`~.DIA_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``. A formula of
:mod:`~.DIA_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on where the projection starts, where it
must answer for a month outside the frame, where it passed a policy month as ``t``, where
it priced a premium off the projection's survival, or where it branched on text; every
other is :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s own. ``products/deferred_income_annuity/model-sec.md`` lists
the rewritten cells with the reason for each.

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent directory,
``products/deferred_income_annuity/``, read at run time rather than stored inside the
model. The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas — no ``_data/``, no IOSpec,
no embedded values — so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an input can
be edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows ``annuallife.TradLife_A``;
contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs *inside* the model through
modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``DIA_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and then
fails on first evaluation.

Each table has a filename Reference and a reader Cells, both on
:mod:`~.DIA_US_SEC.Data`. The four assumption tables are the files :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`
reads, read in place; the model point table and the premium schedule are this model's
own:

.. rubric:: Two clocks

``t`` counts months from the **valuation date**, 0-based, the clock
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` runs on: ``t = 0`` is the valuation month for every model
point, however long the contract has been in force, month ``t`` runs from time ``t`` to
time ``t + 1``, and the frame is ``t = 0 .. proj_len() - 1``, where :func:`proj_len`
counts the months from the valuation date to the stop rule. Row ``t`` is the same month
for every point, so the frames of a block line up and sum row by row. Survival is indexed
by a **time point** on this clock rather than by a month: ``lives_if(t, life)`` and
``lives_if_last(t)`` are survival *at* time ``t``, the start of month ``t``, so month
``t`` opens at time ``t`` and closes at time ``t + 1``, the deaths of month ``t`` are
``l(t) - l(t + 1)``, and the arrears survival point is ``t + 1``, as in
:mod:`~.DIA_US_S`.

``duration_mth(t)`` counts **policy months**, the months elapsed from issue at the start
of month ``t``: ``duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``, where
:func:`duration_mth_init` is read from the model point — positive for a contract already
in force at the valuation date, 0 for one issued at it, ``-k`` for one to be issued ``k``
months later, at most ten years later. It is the technical notes' month index, and
everything contractual reads it: the completed policy years
``duration(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12``, the contractual 1-based label
``policy_year(t) = duration(t) + 1``, the attained ages ``age(t, life)``, the premium
months, the income start month ``T``, the three option months, the payment months, the
COLA anniversaries and the certain period. ``T``, the premium months and the option months
stay policy months and are compared with ``duration_mth(t)``: converted to ``t`` they
would collide with the ``-1`` that the option accessors return for "never", and turn
negative on a contract past them. A cell keyed directly by this clock takes ``k``, a
policy month or the time point that opens it, or ``y``, a policy year, never ``t``: the
pricing cells and the payout schedule are keyed by ``k``, and the annual mortality rate by
``y``. The months from the income start month, the payout phase's own count, are this
clock less ``T``. No cell is keyed by them: :func:`is_payment_pm`, :func:`cola_factor_pm`,
:func:`certain_floor_pm` and :func:`annuity_pp_sched_pm` take a policy month ``k`` and
form ``k - T`` inside, so that the contract's schedules, its premiums and its options share
one key. The anchor cell in force 241 months, point 19, is in policy year 21 at ``t = 0``,
a month after its income start month ``T = 240``, and point 18, the payment-acceleration
contract in force 59 months, pays its second premium at policy month 60, ``t = 1``.

The **stop rule** ends every frame where it ends :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s: :func:`stop_mth` is
:mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s frame length from issue, the month the youngest covered life attains
the limiting age or the end of the guarantee period if that is later, and :func:`is_active`
is ``0 <= duration_mth(t) < stop_mth()``. A contract's own end inside the frame, its last
death or the end of its guarantee, is a probability or a floor reaching zero, and the
frame runs on with zeros, as :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s does.

Three inputs, and their clocks. Expense inflation reads the **valuation** clock,
``inflation_factor(t) = (1 + inflation_rate) ** (t // 12)``, :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s annual
steps moved onto ``t``, so that the maintenance charge is in valuation-date dollars for
every point alike. Mortality improvement stays on the **policy** clock, because it is
already calendar-dated: its exponent is the calendar year less ``mort_table_year``, and the
calendar year ``issue_year() + duration(t)`` is the one the contract reaches whatever the
valuation date, so a contract in force reads the improvement of its own calendar years and
nothing is re-based. The commutation discount rate moves with the reference rate's change
since issue, on one path every point shares: for a contract on the books at the valuation
date, the change to that date, which a contract in force carries in its opening state,
plus ``ref_rate_shift``, a change made at the valuation date; for a contract issued later,
after that change, none.

On a point issued at the valuation date the two clocks coincide and this model computes
what :mod:`~.DIA_US_S` computes: every cell the two share agrees at every argument
:mod:`~.DIA_US_S` evaluates in its sweep, but for three whose meaning changed,
``pols_if_init``, now the count already in force at the valuation date, ``model_point``, a
row of another table, and ``result_pols``, which gains the month's new business. That is
how the worked example carries over, and ``tests/test_model_conventions.py`` asserts it
cell by cell.

.. rubric:: Counts

The count on the books is the number of contracts the point stands for,
:func:`policy_count`, from issue to the stop rule. Mortality decrements each life's
survival, :func:`lives_if`, never the count: the two lives are independent, so their two
probabilities are the whole survival state, and every cash flow is the count times a
per-contract amount weighted by survival, as :mod:`~.DIA_US_S` weights every flow by its
constant ``pols_if_init``. So ``pols_if_at(t, "BEF_NB")`` is :func:`pols_if_init`, the
count already in force, at :func:`t_entry`, the first month on the books, the whole count
after it, and 0 outside the frame; and ``pols_if_at(t, "BEF_DECR")`` adds
:func:`pols_new_biz`, the contracts issued in month ``t``. The ``"BEF_DECR"`` count weights
every cash flow of row ``t``. A contract in force at the valuation date opens with its
``policy_count``; one issued at or after it opens with none, and takes its
``policy_count`` as new business in its issue month, ``duration_mth(t) = 0``. New business
brings its premium schedule and no acquisition cost, as in :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`, which has
none.

:func:`pols_if` keeps :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s definition on that count: the contracts on the
books weighted by the probability that a covered life is alive at the start of month
``t``, ``pols_if_at(t, "BEF_DECR") * lives_if_last(t)``, which carries the maintenance
expense. It is not the count before decrements, which mortality never moves: on point 20,
the period-certain point in force 300 months, ``pols_if(0)`` is 0.5577 against a count of
1.0, as ``DIA_US_S``'s ``pols_if(300)`` is, and the registry marks the model
``survival_pols_if`` for that reason. There is no lapse decrement, and no ``pols_lapse``.

.. rubric:: The opening state

A contract in force at the valuation date carries eight things its count and its policy
clock do not say. Each is read from its model point as it stands at the start of month
0, before any month-0 event:

``lives_if_init_1``, ``lives_if_init_2``
    each covered life's probability of being alive at the valuation date,
    :func:`lives_if_init`. On a real record it is 1 or 0, and a joint contract may carry
    one life already dead; on a point restated from :mod:`~.DIA_US_S` at its month ``d``
    it is :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s ``lives_if(d, life)``, a probability. The lives are
    independent, as in :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`, so the two per-life probabilities are the whole
    survival state. Life 2 is 0 on a single-life contract.
``cum_premium_pp_init``, ``annual_income_init``
    ``CP`` and ``B`` entering month 0: the premiums paid before the valuation date and the
    guaranteed annual income their slices bought, a start-date adjustment already
    exercised included, :func:`cum_premium_pp_init` and :func:`annual_income_init`.
    ``CP`` is the base of the death benefit and of the refund, and ``B`` of the income;
    the premiums still due are in the premium schedule, so the two columns and the
    schedule hold all of the premium history the projection reads.
``guarantee_mths_pricing_init``
    on a cash or installment refund in force, ``n_g`` as the pricing kernel takes it,
    :func:`guarantee_mths_pricing_init`: a fixed point over the **whole** premium schedule,
    the slices bought included, which prices every slice still to be bought and a
    start-date adjustment still to come. The schedule holds only the premiums still due,
    and the iteration depends on the path, so neither the schedule nor ``CP`` and ``B``
    can recover it.
``surv_to_payout_init``
    on a contract past its income start month, the cohort that reached the income phase,
    ``l_last(T)``, :func:`surv_to_payout_init`, which weights every guaranteed
    instalment. It is **not** the probability that a life is alive: in a certain period
    the contract stays open after the last death, its guarantee running on to a
    beneficiary, so on point 20, in force 300 months, it is 0.715 while
    ``lives_if_last(0)`` is 0.5577. On a real record in payout it is 1.
``commute_weight_init``
    on a contract that commuted before the valuation month, the cohort that commuted,
    ``l_last(t_c)``, :func:`commute_weight_init`, whose guaranteed instalments the
    commutation extinguished; the rest of the cohort that reached the income phase keeps
    its guarantee. On a real record of a commuted contract it is 1.
``ref_rate_shift_init``
    the reference rate at the valuation date less the reference rate at issue,
    :func:`ref_rate_shift_init`: the part of the change since issue, which moves the
    commutation discount rate, that the contract has already seen. A fact of the market,
    the same for two contracts issued together.

At issue each covered life is 1, the premiums paid, the income bought and the change 0,
and the three other columns blank, so a point issued at or after the valuation date
carries those values. Each of the two frozen weights is blank where its instant, the income
start month or the commutation month, is at or after the valuation month: the projection
derives it there from the lives, :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s own ``l_last`` at that month.
Nothing else carries a path. The acceleration factor is read only in the exercise month,
and a contract valued after its exercise paid the lump sum before the valuation date,
its blackout months paying nothing. The commuted fraction follows from the policy clock:
the commutation is one exercise named on the model point, and there is no withdrawal. The
certain months left follow from ``duration_mth``. And the instalments scheduled to date,
``G``, are a deterministic schedule fixed by the income at the income start month
(below).

.. rubric:: Pricing on the policy clock

:mod:`~.DIA_US_S` uses one survival curve for two jobs: **pricing** each premium's paid-up
slice at its own date, and **projecting**. On the valuation clock they part. The
projection's survival, :func:`lives_if`, opens at the valuation date from the opening
state. Pricing stays anchored at issue and at the premium dates, deterministic from the
contract's terms: :func:`lives_if_pm`, survival from issue to a policy time point ``k``,
is one explicit loop from issue over the monthly rates, :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s recursion
unrolled, the same products in the same order, so every purchase rate, every pricing
factor and every guarantee period is :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s to the last bit. The monthly rate
comes from one place, :func:`mort_rate_py`, the annual rate of a policy year, which the
projection's :func:`mort_rate` reads at the policy year of month ``t``, so the two curves
use one rate, as :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s one curve did. So pricing shares the valuation's
mortality basis, its A/E and its improvement, as :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s does: a mortality
sensitivity moves the purchase rate of every premium still due, and every twin's and
future row's guarantee period and income, while a contract in force keeps the guarantee
period it was priced with, ``guarantee_mths_pricing_init``. Every pricing cell is keyed
by the premium's or the exercise's policy month ``k``, :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s ``t`` renamed:
:func:`income_start_mth_at`, :func:`deferral_yrs`, :func:`surv_to_income_start`,
:func:`rop_factor_calc`, :func:`rop_factor`, :func:`annuity_factor_def` and
:func:`purchase_rate`. Pricing never reads the projection, so a cold ``net_cf(0)`` runs a
handful of cells deep where :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s recurses through survival to the payout
date.

The payout phase reads the income ahead of ``t``: the installment refund's search for its
certain period, the refund balance, the commuted value and the accelerated instalments.
On the valuation clock the income ``B`` and the cumulative premium ``CP`` are recursions,
and reading them far ahead would open a chain as long as the deferral. So the payout
schedule is fixed at the income start month, from :func:`annual_income_payout`,
``B(T)``, and :func:`cum_premium_payout`, ``CP(T)``, each one loop over the policy months
from the valuation date's to ``T``, in :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s order. The schedule rests on
``B`` being level from ``T`` on, which the product guarantees and ``Data`` checks: no
premium falls at or after ``T``, and a start-date adjustment is exercised before its new
start month. :func:`annuity_pp_sched_pm` is the instalment of policy month ``k`` on that
schedule, and :func:`cum_annuity_pp` sums it, ``G``, keyed by policy month and based at
the valuation date's, so that the refund of a cash refund long in payout reads ``G`` from
there forward, recursing back to that key and no further.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cells names follow lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` and ``savings.CashValue_SE``
wherever those models have an analogue, and — for everything in the income phase — they
follow :mod:`.SPIA_US_S` **exactly**, because the payout phase of a DIA *is* a single
premium immediate annuity. What running in force adds is named as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` names it: ``duration_mth`` read from the model point,
``policy_count``, ``pols_new_biz``, ``pols_if_at`` with its ``"BEF_NB"`` and
``"BEF_DECR"`` timings, ``is_active`` and ``result_pols``. ``duration_mth_init``, the
policy months completed at the valuation date, takes ``UL_US_S``'s name, and each
opening-state column is ``<cell>_init``, the cell it opens with ``_init`` added, read per
life by ``lives_if_init(life)``. ``t_entry`` and ``stop_mth`` are the SEC family's own. A
cell keyed by policy month carries ``_pm``, as in ``SPIA_US_SEC``, beside the ``_py`` that
``Term_US_SEC`` gives a policy-year key, a table reader keyed by attained age carries
``_at``, and a quantity fixed at the income start month carries ``_payout``. The ``is_*``
decodes turn the model point's text columns into the flags the projection branches on,
each reading and validating its column as :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s label accessor does, so that
no other projection cell compares text and none calls a label accessor (``sex``,
``income_form``, ...), which is left to reporting. The technical notes use compact
actuarial symbols instead. The mapping is:

========================  ==================================  ==============================

Every input of the notes has a row above, and so do the model's own additions, which the
notes give no symbol but which drive the in-force projection: the counts, the clocks, the
opening state and the decodes. Only the outputs and diagnostics are left out —
:func:`model_point`, :func:`premium_schedule`, the annual display cells
:func:`lives_if_ann`, :func:`claims_ann` and :func:`annuity_payments_ann`, the reports
:func:`result_cf`, :func:`result_pols` and :func:`result_annual`, and the ``check_*``
cells — because they are not quantities the notes define.

Seven names in that table needed care.

``l`` and ``L`` differ in the notes only by case — the survival probability versus the
life-contingent payment factor — so they become ``lives_if`` and
``payment_factor_life``, exactly as in :mod:`.SPIA_US_S`. ``L`` is *also* the
expense and profit load in equation (4); that one is the Reference ``expense_load``.

``l`` is also two curves here, where the notes have one: the projection's
:func:`lives_if`, on the valuation clock from the opening state, and the pricing kernel's
:func:`lives_if_pm`, on the policy clock from issue. On a point issued at the valuation
date they are the same numbers at every time point.

``B`` is the guaranteed **annual** income and ``B(t)/m`` is one instalment; the notes
never name the instalment, so it takes the chassis name ``annuity_pp_sched``. Note that
``annual_income(t)`` is indexed by **month**, not by policy year as in
:mod:`.SPIA_US_S`, because a DIA's income level changes when a *premium* is paid
and premiums fall on months.

``n_g`` is three different quantities in the notes and they must not be conflated.
:func:`guarantee_mths_pricing` is the guarantee period fed into the pricing kernel by
equation (5) — a fixed point, since ``n_g = CP(T)/B`` and ``B`` depends on ``n_g``.
:func:`guarantee_yrs` is the realized value once ``B`` is known, the 3.3891 years the
worked example quotes. And :func:`certain_mths_eff` — the *projection's* certain floor —
is **zero on a cash-refund contract**, because a cash refund is a lump sum at death, not
a stream of guaranteed payments. Equation (5) is a pricing approximation for both refund
forms; only installment refund actually pays a certain stream.

``theta`` appears **nowhere** in the DIA notes.  ``theta_cum``, the cumulative commuted
fraction, is inherited from the immediate-annuity notes that these notes incorporate by
reference for the whole income phase; the DIA notes write equations (13) and (14) with
no symbol for the fraction at all.  The cells keeps the chassis name,
:func:`commute_frac_cum`, so that the two models read alike.

Two cohort weights carry no notes symbol because the notes have no need of one: a SPIA
is already in payment and its whole model point reaches the income phase together.
:func:`surv_to_payout` is ``l_last(T)``, the cohort that ever reaches the income phase
and therefore the only cohort a guarantee period can pay; :func:`commute_weight` is
``l_last(t_c)``, the sub-cohort still alive to exercise a commutation and therefore the
only cohort whose guarantee a commutation can extinguish.  They are the same idea
applied at two dates, and getting either of them wrong moves the guaranteed leg without
moving anything else. A contract valued after either date carries it in its opening
state, because the lives at the valuation date can no longer say it.

``CP(T)`` is the DIA-specific change to the payout chassis and the notes' own listed
pitfall: **the refund base is cumulative premiums, not the initial premium.** Where
``SPIA_US_S`` writes ``premium_pp()``, this model writes :func:`cum_premium_payout`.

The self-checks follow the library-wide ``check_*`` convention, which is
``CashValue_SE.check_av_roll_fwd()``'s: each check takes **no argument and returns a
bool** covering every projected ``t``, so one test can call the same name across every
model in the library, and each carries a companion ``check_*_resid(t)`` returning the
signed float residual at a single ``t`` for the debugging session that follows a failure.
The bool is defined in terms of the residual, never the other way round.
:func:`check_lives_roll_fwd`, :func:`check_income_roll_fwd`,
:func:`check_payment_factor` and :func:`check_commutation_value` are the four here; there
is no ``check_av_roll_fwd``, because there is no account value to roll forward.

.. rubric:: The state variables do not share one timing

Month ``t`` spans time ``t`` to time ``t + 1``, and the state cells sit at three different
instants inside it.

- ``l(t)`` and ``RG(t)`` are **start-of-month** values. ``lives_if(t, life)`` is survival
  to the start of month ``t``; :func:`refund_balance` is measured before the arrears
  instalment due at the end of the month, ``CP(T) - G(m - 1)`` at policy month ``m``,
  which is why a death in month ``T`` refunds the full ``CP(T)``. (On *advance* timing the
  instalment paid at the start of the month has been paid, so that one is netted:
  ``CP(T) - G(m)``.)
- ``CP(t)`` and ``B(t)`` are the values **during** month ``t`` — after the premium
  received at its start, which is exactly what makes the deferral death benefit
  ``CP(t) * l(t) * q(t)`` right and what lets a slice bought at the start of ``t`` be
  guaranteed from that moment. Entering month 0 they are the opening state, the values
  :mod:`~.DIA_US_S` holds during the month before the valuation month.
- ``G(k)`` is a **closing** balance: cumulative scheduled instalments through the *end*
  of policy month ``k``. ``G`` and ``RG`` are therefore exactly one month apart by
  construction, not by accident.

None of them is a recursion seed living before the frame: each opens at :func:`t_entry`,
from the opening state in force and from its value at issue otherwise, and nothing in this
model is indexed at a time point before it on the valuation clock.

.. rubric:: Two pricing bases: tabulated and computed

The notes' worked example is priced off illustrative factors it states outright —
``a^(12)_80(cash refund, female; 4.75%) = 8.60``, ``A_rop(60, 20) = 0.157900``,
``A_rop(65, 15) = 0.180200`` — declaring them "mutually consistent illustrative values,
**not** table lookups". Both readings are shipped, and which one applies is a model point
column:

``factor_basis = "table"``
    :func:`payout_factor` and :func:`rop_factor` read the shipped factor tables, and
    :func:`annuity_factor_def` is the notes' equation (1) literally,
    ``v^d * _d p_x * a^(m)``. Model points 1, 2 and 4, and the points restated from point
    1, 19 and 25. This is the basis that reproduces the worked example. It is single-life
    only: equation (1) factorizes the deferral survival out of the payout APV, which a
    joint status does not permit, and ``Data`` refuses a joint contract on it.

``factor_basis = "formula"``
    :func:`payout_factor_calc` computes equation (2) and :func:`rop_factor_calc` the
    notes' mid-band approximation of equation (3), both off the shipped mortality table,
    and :func:`annuity_factor_def` values the whole deferred stream in one pass so joint
    forms work. Model points 3, 5 to 18, 20 to 24 and 26.

The shipped mortality table is **[std]**, built so that the two bases agree where the
notes say they should: its rates over ages 60-84 are band-constant values reproducing
the notes' five-year survival anchors exactly, and the geometric continuation past age
85 is calibrated so that equation (2) at the income start age returns 8.600 — the notes'
own illustrative payout factor. Where they then *disagree* is ``A_rop(60, 20)``; see
below.

.. rubric:: The A_rop(60, 20) divergence is shipped, not resolved

The notes say ``A_rop`` was "computed from the same survival anchors with a mid-band
death-timing approximation". Run that recipe and the twenty-year factor comes out at
**0.161605**, not the **0.157900** the notes print, while the fifteen-year factor comes
out at **0.180241** against a printed **0.180200** — agreement to four decimal places.
One of the two is arithmetically consistent with the stated recipe and the other is not.
Rather than choose, the model ships both: model point 1 takes the printed factors from
``rop_factor_table.csv`` and reproduces the worked example, model point 3 is otherwise
identical and computes them. A test of :mod:`~.DIA_US_S`'s pins the gap open, and the twin
identity carries it here.

.. rubric:: The purchase-rate rounding is a [std] convention, and it is worth 3.6 cents

The worked example computes ``B_1 = 100,000 x 0.321765 = $32,176.50`` from a purchase
rate printed to six decimals. At full precision ``pr_1 = 0.3217647`` and the same
premium buys ``$32,176.47``; over both slices the difference is 3.6 cents on a
``$44,259.65`` income. The model point column ``purchase_rate_dp`` carries the
convention — 6 on point 1, blank (full precision) on point 2 — so the worked example
reproduces to the cent without the rounding being hidden.

.. rubric:: The certain period is a floor, not a second stream

``payment_factor(t) = max(certain_floor(t) * l_last(T), payment_factor_life(t))`` is
inherited from the payout chassis and is the notes' first-listed payout pitfall. During
the certain period the full, *unreduced* instalment is payable regardless of survival; an
additive construction would pay ``1 + L`` and silently double the guarantee. The ``max``
also reproduces, with no extra logic, the rule that a survivor reduction falling inside a
guarantee period is deferred to the end of that period.

.. rubric:: There is no lapse decrement, and adding one is a defect

"Lapse and surrender: exactly zero, at all durations. Not conservatism — there is no
surrender benefit to elect [R9][R13]. A nonzero lapse assumption in a DIA model is a
defect, not a margin." There is no ``lapse_rate``, no ``pols_lapse``, no surrender cash
flow row and no account value roll-forward in this model, and none should be added:
the liability is a schedule of income slices keyed on (premium, purchase date, income
start date, income option), not a balance.

    derived from the projection they bound, so the frame never depends on the survival
    path.

    Two kinds of point have no frame, and raise here, naming the point, rather than
    projecting nothing: an in-force extract should not carry either.  A point at or past
    the stop rule.  And a contract that owes nothing after the valuation date: in force,
    with every covered life dead at the valuation date, valued at or before its income
    start month, whose every death fell in the deferral and whose death benefit, if any,
    was paid before the valuation date; or valued after it, with its certain period over
    or no certain period at all, the refund, if any, having been paid at the last death.
    This is ``Term_US_SEC``'s point past its cover, for a product whose cover can end with
    a death.  The rule needs the certain period, which an installment refund derives from
    the payout schedule, so it is checked here rather than in ``Data``, and each message
    says why nothing is owed.  A contract in its certain period with every life dead pays
    the beneficiary, and projects.

    And one combination of the two payout options raises here, naming the point, because
    neither model prices it: an acceleration on the books, at or after the valuation date,
    whose lump sum pulls forward instalments of a guarantee that a commutation before it
    has reduced.  The lump sum pays each instalment it pulls forward at the payment
    factor, unreduced, as ``DIA_US_S``'s does, so the cohort that commuted would be paid
    those instalments again.  The guarantee's end needs the certain period, so this too is
    checked here.  ``Data`` refuses the two options within six months of each other, the
    product's interlock; an acceleration that pulls forward only the life-contingent
    instalments after the guarantee projects, and so does one paid before the valuation
    date, whose blackout months pay nothing.

    pricing feeds.  Do not "tidy" ``last`` to the frame's end; it would move golden
