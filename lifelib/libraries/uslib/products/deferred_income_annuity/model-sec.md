# In-Force Implementation Notes

**Status:** Draft, 2026-11-02. `DIA_US_SEC` is [`DIA_US_S`](model.md) taught to project
from a valuation date. Besides contracts issued at that date, it takes contracts already in
force there, in their deferral or in their income phase, and contracts to be issued in the
ten years after it, as lifelib's `basiclife/BasicTerm_SE` extends `basiclife/BasicTerm_S`.
The product is the one [`product-spec.md`](product-spec.md) specifies and
[`technical-notes.md`](technical-notes.md) models, and its income phase is the payout
chassis that [`SPIA_US_SEC`](../immediate_annuity/model-sec.md) runs in force; this page
says what running in force changes, and how the model compiles. The suffix adds lifelib's
letters to `S`: `E` for in force, as in `BasicTerm_SE`, and `C` for the compiled form, as in
`basiclife/BasicTerm_SC`: the same formulas compile under modelx-cython, from
`sample_sec.py` and `spec_sec.py` beside the model.

> **This is a mechanics demonstration, not a pricing or reserving result.** The model is
> `DIA_US_S` on another time axis, and it reads `DIA_US_S`'s assumption tables in place,
> every assumption unchanged. The contractual elements — the paid-up income slice each
> premium buys at then-current rates, the 100% return-of-premium deferral death benefit,
> the one-time ±5-year income start date adjustment, six months of payment acceleration,
> commutation with the life-contingent tail preserved, the QLAC restriction set and its
> $210,000 2026 premium limit, the $50 maintenance expense escalated at 2.5%, and the
> absence of any lapse or annuitization decrement — are sourced. **The entire pricing
> kernel is not.** No purchase-rate table exists: the Insurance Compact expressly relieves
> the insurer of disclosing the deferral-period mortality and interest basis
> [R13 §1.B(1)(a)](#uslib-deferred_income_annuity-r13), so the 4.75% pricing rate,
> the 6.0% expense and profit load, the mortality table, the illustrative payout and
> return-of-premium factors, the 100 bp repricing spread and the 50 bp commutation margin
> are all **[std]** constructions. Replace them with company data before drawing any
> conclusion from the numbers.

## Run it

```bash
python products/deferred_income_annuity/run_sec.py            # point 1: the anchor cell
python products/deferred_income_annuity/run_sec.py 19         # the anchor, in payout
python products/deferred_income_annuity/run_sec.py --block    # every model point, summed
python products/deferred_income_annuity/run_sec.py 19 --cython  # point 19, compiled
```

`--cython` runs the compiled model and prints the same lines. The runner builds it beside
the model with the repository's `tools/build_sec_cy.py` the first time, in about a minute,
and again whenever the model, `sample_sec.py`, `spec_sec.py` or the tool is newer than the
build, and says so on stderr. `--build DIR` runs a build made elsewhere instead (*The
compiled model*, below). Nothing a build leaves is committed, and `.gitignore` covers it.

The first prints what `run.py` prints for `DIA_US_S`'s point 1, the worked example's anchor
cell, issued here at the valuation date: its terms, its frame, its pricing factors and its
income, the technical notes' annual display grid for policy years 1 to 25 and the monthly
cash flows around the income start date, every number the same, with the first fifteen rows
of `result_cf()` and `result_pols()` between them. The second prints the same cell in force
241 months, a month into its income phase, its cash refund running. At `t = 0` it pays what
`DIA_US_S` pays in its month 241: the instalment of 3,688.30 weighted by survival, 2,615.39,
and refund claims of 430.52 on a refund balance of 150,000 − 3,688.30 = 146,311.70. Its
expenses are in valuation-date dollars, 2.97 at `t = 0` where `DIA_US_S`'s month 241 carries
4.86, twenty years' inflation more, and `liability_cf` and `net_cf` move with them. Its
annual grid opens at policy year 21, the one the valuation date falls in, whose row holds
that year's months from the valuation date on: refund claims of 4,059.21 over policy months
241 to 251, where `DIA_US_S`'s policy year 21 holds 4,502.42 over its twelve. Three lines to
the same thing for point 19:

```python
import modelx as mx
model = mx.read_model("products/deferred_income_annuity/DIA_US_SEC")
model.Projection[18].result_cf()     # point 19, the table's nineteenth row
```

`Projection` takes `idx`, the position of a point in the table, as `basiclife/BasicTerm_SC`
does: `Projection[18]` is point 19, and its `point_id()` says so. `result_cf()` has
`DIA_US_S`'s eight
columns — `pols_if`, `premiums`, `annuity_payments`, `claims`, `commutations`, `expenses`,
and the net stream under both signs, `liability_cf` and `net_cf` — with one row per month
from the valuation date, `t = 0 … proj_len() − 1`. `result_pols()` sets out what lies behind
it on the same rows: `pols_if` and `pols_new_biz`, the contracts issued in the month, then
`DIA_US_S`'s survival and payment-factor columns in `DIA_US_S`'s order, the survival read
at the start of each month, and every column 0 before a point is issued. `result_annual()`
is the notes' annual display grid, keyed by the policy year as in `DIA_US_S`, from the
policy year the valuation date falls in.

`--block` asks every point for its frame before it projects any, then projects each and
releases its ItemSpace once its frame is read, so the run holds the cells of one point at
a time. Deleting it, `del model.Projection[idx]`, is not enough: an ItemSpace sits in
reference cycles, which only Python's cyclic collector frees, so the runner collects after
each release. It freezes everything alive (`gc.freeze()`) once the model and its table are
read, and again once it has asked every point for its frame, so that each collection scans
only what the block has made since. It keeps the block's sum as it goes, compensated as
pandas sums a `groupby`, so that the block is, bit for bit, the frames concatenated and
summed by `t`, as below. It prints a line per point on where it stands at the valuation
date, then the block's first fifteen rows and the block summed into projection years,
`t // 12 + 1`. The shipped table is a set of test cases standing at
different calendar dates (*Two clocks*, below), so the block shows how the frames add, and
nothing more.

## Two clocks

The model runs on two clocks, and each formula reads the one its quantity belongs to.

- **`t`, the valuation clock**, counts months from the valuation date. `t = 0` is the
  valuation month for every model point, however long the contract has been in force,
  month `t` runs from time `t` to time `t + 1`, and the frame runs
  `t = 0 … proj_len() − 1`, where `proj_len()` is the number of months from the valuation
  date to the stop rule. The projection's survival is indexed by a **time point** on this
  clock: `lives_if(t, life)` and `lives_if_last(t)` are survival *at* time `t`, the start
  of month `t`, so the deaths of month `t` are `lives_if(t, life) − lives_if(t + 1, life)`
  and an arrears instalment is paid on survival to time `t + 1`, as in `DIA_US_S`.
- **`duration_mth(t)`, the policy clock**, counts the months elapsed from issue at the
  start of month `t`: `duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t`, with
  `duration_mth_init()` read from the model point. It is the technical notes' month index,
  and the contract runs on it: `duration(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12`,
  `policy_year(t) = duration(t) + 1`, `age(t, life) = age_at_entry(life) + duration(t)`
  and `calendar_year(t) = issue_year() + duration(t)`, as in `DIA_US_S`, and through them
  the premium months, the income start month `T`, the three option months, the payment
  months, the COLA anniversaries and the certain period. `T`, the premium months and the
  option months stay policy months, compared with `duration_mth(t)`: converted to `t` they
  would collide with the `−1` the option accessors return for "never", and turn negative on
  a contract past them. A cell keyed on this clock takes `k`, a policy month or the time
  point that opens it, or `y`, a policy year: `premium_pm(k)`, the premium of a policy
  month; `lives_if_pm(k, life)`, the pricing kernel's survival from issue; the pricing
  cells, keyed by the premium's or the exercise's month; and `mort_rate_py(y, life)`, the
  annual mortality rate of a policy year. The two table readers,
  `mort_rate_base_at(x, life)` and `improvement_rate_at(x, life)`, take an attained age,
  `x`. `BasicTerm_SE` reaches the policy clock by adding one a month, a recursion as long
  as the frame; the closed form needs no such chain of calls.

The months from the income start month, the payout phase's own count, are the policy clock
less `T`, and no cell is keyed by them. `is_payment_pm(k)`, `cola_factor_pm(k)`,
`annuity_pp_sched_pm(k)` and `certain_floor_pm(k)` take a policy month and form `k − T`
inside, so that the payment schedule, the COLA, the certain floor, the premiums and the
options share one key, and `cum_annuity_pp(k)`, the notes' `G(k)`, the instalments
scheduled through the end of policy month `k`, keeps `DIA_US_S`'s key. A key counted from
`T` would be negative throughout the deferral.

The **stop rule** ends every frame where it ends `DIA_US_S`'s. `stop_mth()` is
`DIA_US_S`'s frame length from issue, `max(horizon_mths(), T + certain_mths_eff())`: the
month the youngest covered life attains the limiting age, 120, or the end of the guarantee
period if that is later. A month is in the contract's frame when
`0 ≤ duration_mth(t) < stop_mth()`, which is `is_active(t)`, and the frame ends with the
last such month, `proj_len() = stop_mth() − duration_mth_init()`. A contract's own end, its
last death or the end of its guarantee, is a probability or a floor reaching zero inside the
frame, which runs on with zeros, as `DIA_US_S`'s does.

Point 19 is the worked example's anchor cell in force 241 months. At `t = 0` it is in
policy year 21, at attained age 80, a month after its income start month, policy month 240;
its next anniversary, policy month 252, falls at `t = 11`, and its frame has 479 rows,
`t = 0 … 478`, to the anchor's last month, policy month 719. Point 18 is the
payment-acceleration contract in force 59 months, in its deferral: its second premium falls
at policy month 60, `t = 1`, its income starts at policy month 240, `t = 181`, and it
accelerates its payments at policy month 252, `t = 193`. Point 26 is the joint contract
issued 13 months after the valuation date: `duration_mth(0) = −13`, it is on the books from
`t_entry() = 13`, rows 0 to 12 are zeros, `policy_year(0)` is −1, its premiums fall at
`t = 13` and `t = 73`, and its frame has 733 rows.

| Read on the policy clock | Read on the valuation clock |
|---|---|
| the premium months and the premiums still due, the income start month and its adjustment, the pricing survival from issue and every purchase rate, payout factor and return-of-premium factor priced on it, the payment months and the instalment schedule, the COLA anniversaries, the certain period and an installment refund's derived period, the instalments scheduled to date that a refund nets, the acceleration and its blackout, the commutation month and the guaranteed months it commutes, the attained ages that key the mortality table, the improvement scale and the two factor tables, the calendar year that dates the improvement, the age stop rule | expense inflation, `inflation_factor(t) = 1.025^(t // 12)` |

Expense inflation alone runs on `t`. `DIA_US_S`'s annual steps,
`(1 + g)^(policy_year(t) − 1)`, keep their shape and move onto the valuation clock, so the
maintenance charge is in valuation-date dollars for every point alike and steps on each
anniversary of the valuation date. The commutation discount rate reads neither clock: it
moves with the reference rate's change since issue, on one path of the reference rate that
every point shares. For a contract on the books at the valuation date that is the change to
the valuation date, an opening-state column, plus `ref_rate_shift`, a change made at the
valuation date; a contract issued later, after it, has seen none (*The opening state*,
below). The repricing of a start-date adjustment reads `baa_yield`, a level that reads
neither clock either. There is no acquisition cost in either model.

**Mortality improvement stays on the policy clock**, because it is already dated by the
calendar. Its exponent is the calendar year less `mort_table_year`, and the calendar year,
`issue_year() + duration(t)`, is the one the contract reaches, whatever the valuation date.
So a contract in force reads the improvement of its own calendar years, and nothing is
re-based: restated from `DIA_US_S` at month `d`, its month `t` is `DIA_US_S`'s month
`d + t` and the same calendar year, and point 16, the generational point, restated at month
240 reads `DIA_US_S`'s `mort_rate(240 + t, life)` exactly. Moving it onto the valuation
clock would need a calendar valuation date, which the model point table does not carry, and
would step a generational basis on the valuation date's anniversaries rather than the
contract's.

That has a consequence for the shipped table. Every row keeps the issue year of the
`DIA_US_S` point it was taken from, 2026, so the rows are test cases standing at different
calendar dates at their common `t = 0`: the twins at issue, point 19 241 months later,
point 26 thirteen months earlier. A real block carries each contract's actual issue year,
and its points then share one valuation date.

Because row `t` is the same month for every point, the frames of a block line up and sum
row by row, which is what `run_sec.py --block` prints:

```python
import pandas as pd
frames = [model.Projection[i].result_cf()
          for i in range(len(model.Data.model_point_table()))]
block = pd.concat(frames).groupby(level="t").sum()
```

On a point issued at `t = 0` the two clocks coincide, and the model computes what
`DIA_US_S` computes, whatever the point's count: neither model charges acquisition, and
every cash flow is the count times an amount per contract. On `DIA_US_S`'s seventeen points
every cash flow and every count agrees, and so does every other cell the two models share
but three whose meaning changed: `pols_if_init()`, now the count already in force at the
valuation date, 0 for such a point; `model_point()`, a row of another table; and
`result_pols()`, which gains `pols_new_biz` and sets `pols_if` first.

## The in-force interface

The model point table is `model_point_table_sec.csv`. It carries `DIA_US_S`'s columns, and
ten of its columns are the in-force interface: `basiclife/BasicTerm_SE`'s two, and eight
that open a contract's state. Every amount is per contract. The premiums still due are in a
second file, `premium_schedule_sec.csv` (*The premium schedule*, below).

| Column | Unit | Measured at | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `policy_count` | contracts, not necessarily whole | for a contract in force, the start of month 0, before any month-0 event; for any other, its issue month | the contracts the point stands for: in force at the valuation date, or issued at or after it. A count of contracts on the books, never weighted by survival |
| `duration_mth` | whole months | the valuation date | the months elapsed from issue: positive in force, in the deferral or the income phase, 0 for a contract issued at the valuation date, `−k` for one to be issued `k` months later, with `k` at most 120 as shipped |
| `lives_if_init_1` | a probability, 0 to 1 | for a contract in force, the valuation date, the start of month 0, before any month-0 death; for any other, issue, where each covered life is 1 | the primary annuitant's survival: 1 or 0 on a real record |
| `lives_if_init_2` | a probability, 0 to 1 | the same | the joint annuitant's survival; 0 on a single-life contract |
| `cum_premium_pp_init` | dollars per contract | the start of month 0, before the premium, if any, received at its start | `CP`, the premiums paid before the valuation date, without interest: the base of the deferral death benefit and, with the premiums still due, of the refund |
| `annual_income_init` | dollars a year per contract, before COLA | the start of month 0, before the slice, if any, bought at its start | `B`, the guaranteed annual income the premiums paid have bought, a start-date adjustment exercised before the valuation date included; past the income start month, the income of every instalment |
| `guarantee_mths_pricing_init` | months, not necessarily whole; blank where not read | fixed by the whole premium schedule, the slices bought and those still due | on a cash or installment refund in force, `n_g` as the pricing kernel takes it, equation (5)'s fixed point, with which every slice still due and a start-date adjustment still to come are priced; blank on every other point |
| `surv_to_payout_init` | a probability above 0, at most 1; blank where not read | from issue to the income start month in force, `T` | on a contract valued after `T`, `l_last(T)`, the cohort that reached the income phase, which weights every guaranteed instalment: 1 on a real record in payout; blank on every other point |
| `commute_weight_init` | a probability above 0, at most 1; blank where not read | from issue to the commutation month, `t_c` | on a contract valued after `t_c`, `l_last(t_c)`, the cohort that commuted, whose guaranteed instalments the commutation extinguished: 1 on a real record of a commuted contract; blank on every other point |
| `ref_rate_shift_init` | a change in a rate, as a decimal: 0.005 for a rise of 50 basis points, of either sign | the valuation date | the reference rate at the valuation date less the reference rate at issue, which moves the commutation discount rate; 0 for a contract issued at or after the valuation date |

At issue each covered life is 1, the premiums paid, the income bought and the reference
rate's change are 0, and the three other columns are blank, so a point issued at or after
the valuation date carries those values, and the twins carry `DIA_US_S`'s own: 1 and 1 on a
joint contract, 1 and 0 on a single-life one, nothing paid or bought, no change. Where
`WholeLife_US_SEC`'s opening state is 0 at issue, an annuitant's survival opens at 1.

The count is a count of contracts, not of lives. A joint contract whose two annuitants have
died inside its guarantee period is one contract on the books, with both its lives at 0,
and is still paying, to a beneficiary. Survival is carried by the two life columns alone:
the lives are independent, as in `DIA_US_S`, so their two probabilities are the whole
survival state, which a count weighted by survival could not carry. On a real record each
life is 1 or 0, and a joint contract may carry one life already dead; a death that has
happened but has not reached the record carries 1, and the model then projects that life as
alive, as the record does. Restated from `DIA_US_S` at month `d`, each is `DIA_US_S`'s
probability, `lives_if(d, life)`.

`CP` and `B` hold the premium history the projection reads. `DIA_US_S` builds both from
issue, each premium adding its amount to `CP` and buying its slice of `B` at the purchase
rate of its own month, and a start-date adjustment repricing `B` in its exercise month.
Entering month 0 they are what the premiums paid before the valuation date have made of
them, an exercised adjustment included: what an administration record of a deferred income
annuity holds, the premiums paid without interest and the guaranteed income bought. The
premiums still due are priced at their own months, as `DIA_US_S` prices them, and added to
both (*Pricing on the policy clock*, below). One quantity of the pricing kernel's also
depends on every premium, paid and due: on the two refund forms `DIA_US_S` prices each
slice with the guarantee period `n_g = CP(T) / B`, a fixed point over the whole schedule,
iterated from a life-only start. The premiums still due cannot recover it, nor can `CP` and
`B`, since the iteration depends on its path, so it is a column, which the record of the
pricing holds. `Data` requires it on every refund form in force, a rule a record meets
without the schedule, though once nothing is left to price, in payout say, no cell the
reports reach reads it, only `payout_factor_calc`.

The frozen weights are where a contract open is not a life alive. A guarantee period pays
the cohort that reached the income phase, `l_last(T)`, whether or not a covered life is
still alive: in a certain period the contract stays open after the last death, its
guarantee running on to a beneficiary. Restated from `DIA_US_S`, that cohort is a
probability, 0.715 on point 20 in force 300 months, against survivors of 0.5577; on a real
record of a contract in payout it is 1, the contract having reached its income phase, and a
record whose lives are 0 inside its guarantee then pays the beneficiary the full instalment.
A commutation, one exercise named on the model point, extinguishes the guaranteed
instalments of the cohort alive to exercise it, `l_last(t_c)`; the rest of the cohort that
reached the income phase, the contracts whose annuitant died between `T` and `t_c`, keeps
its guarantee. On a real record of a commuted contract it is 1. Where either instant is at
or after the valuation month the column is blank, and the projection derives the weight
from the lives, as `DIA_US_S` does: `lives_if_last` at that month on the valuation clock,
time 0 on a contract valued at its income start month. `surv_to_payout_init` is required on
every contract past its income start month, a rule a record meets without the certain
period, though on a cash refund or a life-only form, which have no certain floor, nothing
reads it.

The reference rate's change is a fact of the market, not of the contract's history: the
reference rate on the valuation date less the reference rate on the contract's issue date,
the same for every contract issued on one date, from a published series.

| `DIA_US_S` | `DIA_US_SEC` | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `pols_if_init` (1.0) | `policy_count` | The count, under BasicTerm_SE's name. `pols_if_init()` now means the count in force at the valuation date, 0 for a point issued at or after it |
| — | `duration_mth` | The policy clock, in months. `DIA_US_S` projects every contract from issue |
| — | `lives_if_init_1`, `lives_if_init_2` | `DIA_US_S` opens every contract with each covered life alive, `lives_if(0, life) = 1` |
| — | `cum_premium_pp_init`, `annual_income_init` | `DIA_US_S` builds `CP` and `B` from 0 at issue, through every premium in its schedule |
| — | `guarantee_mths_pricing_init` | `DIA_US_S` takes its fixed point over the whole premium schedule, which for a contract in force the schedule no longer holds |
| — | `surv_to_payout_init`, `commute_weight_init` | `DIA_US_S` reads `l_last(T)` and `l_last(t_c)` off its own survival from issue, whatever month reads them |
| — | `ref_rate_shift_init` | `DIA_US_S` reads the change since issue from one Reference, `ref_rate_shift`, which every point shares because every one is issued at its `t = 0`. Contracts issued at different dates have seen different changes, which one Reference cannot hold |

Four things `DIA_US_S` computes from issue need no column:

- **The instalments scheduled to date**, `G`, which a cash refund nets on death and an
  installment refund searches for its derived period. The income is level from the income
  start month on, so `G` is a deterministic as-if-alive schedule, fixed by the income at
  that month, the COLA, the frequency and the timing, and the model sums it by policy month
  (*The opening state*, below).
- **The acceleration's weight**, the payment factor the five instalments pulled forward
  carry. `DIA_US_S` reads it in the exercise month alone; a contract valued after its
  exercise paid the lump sum before the valuation date, and its blackout months pay nothing.
- **The commuted fraction**, `commute_frac_cum`. The commutation is one exercise named on
  the model point, so the fraction follows from the policy clock,
  `duration_mth(t) ≥ t_c`, and there is no withdrawal to carry.
- **The certain months left**, `T + certain_mths_eff() − duration_mth`, and none once
  `duration_mth` reaches the end of the guarantee.

The columns carried over are read as `DIA_US_S` reads them. For a contract in force, the
facts they record are those of issue, and the three options are exercises named on the
model point, as in `DIA_US_S`: deterministic, off by default, and, once past, in the
opening state, an adjustment in `annual_income_init`, a commutation in
`commute_weight_init`.

| Column | Unit | Measured at |
|---|---|---|
| `point_id`, `policy_id` | labels | — |
| `issue_age`, `joint_age` | years, age nearest birthday; `joint_age` blank on a single-life contract | issue, not the valuation date: `age(0, life)` is the attained age there |
| `sex`, `joint_sex` | `M` or `F` | — |
| `joint`, `survivor_pct`, `reduction_trigger` | the joint flag, the survivor percentage, `either` or `primary` | issue |
| `market_type` | `NQ`, `TradIRA`, `RothIRA` or `QLAC` | issue |
| `income_form`, `db_form`, `certain_period` | `LO`, `LO_ROP`, `CR`, `IR` or `PC`; `ROP` or `NONE`; years, 10 to 30 on `PC` and 0 otherwise | issue |
| `income_start_mth` | a policy month: the income starts at the start of month `T` | issue, the elected `T`; an exercised adjustment moves it to `adjust_start_mth` |
| `frequency`, `timing` | payments a year, 12, 4, 2 or 1; `arrears` or `advance` | issue; the payment months fall on the policy clock |
| `cola_rate` | a rate a year, compound | issue; the income steps on each anniversary of the income start date |
| `issue_year` | a calendar year | issue: the anchor of the generational improvement |
| `mort_basis`, `factor_basis`, `purchase_rate_dp` | `anchor` or `generational`; `table` or `formula`; decimal places, blank for full precision | modelling switches and a **[std]** convention of the pricing kernel, not facts about the contract |
| `adjust_mth`, `adjust_start_mth`, `accel_mth`, `commute_mth` | policy months, blank for never | the exercise named on the model point |
| `commute_frac` | the fraction of the remaining guaranteed payments commuted, 0 to 1 | the commutation |
| `other_qlac_premium` | dollars paid to any other intended QLAC | the owner's representation, read by the QLAC overlay alone |
| `provenance` | text: `DIA_US_S`'s on a twin, the generator's on any other row | — |

Three more columns, `row_kind`, `source_policy_id` and `source_mth`, record where the
generator took each shipped row from (below). No formula reads them, and an in-force
extract need not carry them: without them the model projects the same numbers, and
`run_sec.py` runs.

`Data.model_point_table()` checks the table as it reads it, over all rows at once. The first
check that fails raises `ValueError`, naming the missing column or every point that fails
it. First the table's own shape:

- the ten in-force columns are present;
- no `point_id` appears twice;
- `policy_count` is a number, zero or more, so not blank, text or infinite;
- `duration_mth` is a whole number of months, read by value, so that `12.0` is 12;
- `duration_mth` is −120 or more. Future new business is written over a horizon,
  `Data.future_horizon_mth`, 120 months as shipped, so that no frame runs longer than the
  stop rule from issue plus ten years: 840 months on the anchor's life at 60, 1,296 at 22,
  the youngest issue age the product allows, and 1,560 at 0, the youngest the model
  projects, 1,561 on an installment refund in advance whose income starts at the age stop,
  its refund period rounded up to a whole instalment. Set to 0, the Reference refuses
  future new business altogether, and a negative horizon is itself refused.

Then the contract's terms, the income start month in force first, because the later checks
read it:

- `income_start_mth` is a whole number of months, 0 or more, a policy month, read by value;
- each option month, `adjust_mth`, `adjust_start_mth`, `accel_mth` and `commute_mth`, is
  blank or a whole number of months, read by value, a negative month reading as never, as
  `DIA_US_S` reads −1;
- the start-date adjustment's two months go together, both blank or both given, and the
  new start month follows the exercise, so that the income start month in force,
  `adjust_start_mth` where an adjustment is named and `income_start_mth` otherwise, comes
  after every premium priced to the old one;
- a start-date adjustment is a deferral option: `adjust_mth` precedes the
  `income_start_mth` it moves, where `DIA_US_S` would pay nothing from that month to the
  exercise;
- an acceleration and a commutation, payout-phase options, fall at or after the income
  start month in force, and six months apart or more, the product's interlock between them
  [S4]: inside the acceleration's blackout, `DIA_US_S`'s commuted value counts the
  instalments the lump sum has paid;
- `joint` is a flag, read by value: `True` or `False`, or 1 or 0, where `DIA_US_S`'s
  `bool()` reads any text, a blank among them, as `True`; `sex` is `M` or `F`, and so is
  `joint_sex` on a joint contract, the two values the tables keyed by sex hold;
- `issue_age`, `certain_period` and, on a joint contract, `joint_age` are whole numbers of
  years, 0 or more, `frequency` a whole number of payments a year and `issue_year` a whole
  calendar year, and `purchase_rate_dp` is blank or a whole number of decimal places, 0 or
  more, each read by value, so that `60.0` is 60;
- `survivor_pct` is a probability, and `cola_rate` and `other_qlac_premium` are numbers,
  zero or more, each reaching a `max` or a comparison that would lose a blank, the payment
  factor's, the refund balance's or the QLAC limit's; `commute_frac` is blank, for none, or
  a fraction, 0 to 1;
- a joint contract is on the formula basis: the table basis, equation (1), factors a single
  life's survival out of the payout factor.

Then the opening state:

- each life column is a probability, 0 to 1; the premiums paid and the income bought are
  numbers, zero or more; the guarantee period is blank or a number of months, zero or more;
  each frozen weight is blank or a probability; the reference rate's change is a number, of
  either sign, the floor applying to the whole change since issue (*The opening state*);
- a single-life contract has no second life: `lives_if_init_2` is 0;
- a contract not yet in force, `duration_mth` 0 or less, holds its values at issue: each
  covered life 1, no premium paid, no income bought and no change in the reference rate;
- `guarantee_mths_pricing_init` is given exactly on a contract in force on a refund form,
  `CR` or `IR`: on new business the kernel derives it from the whole schedule, and the
  other forms fix it, at the elected certain period or at 0;
- `surv_to_payout_init` is given exactly where `duration_mth` is after the income start
  month in force, and `commute_weight_init` exactly where the commutation month precedes
  `duration_mth`;
- a commutation is taken in the income phase by part of the cohort that reached it, so
  `commute_weight_init` is at most `surv_to_payout_init`, and each frozen weight is at least
  the probability that a covered life is alive at the valuation date, the cohort it weighs
  including every life still alive;
- each frozen weight, where given, is above 0: a contract in force past its income start
  month reached it, and a commutation is exercised by an owner alive to exercise it, so
  neither cohort is empty. At 0 the guarantee of a contract whose lives have all died would
  pay nothing, a contract owing nothing that would project.

The table is returned with the columns those checks read by value, the policy months and
the contract's whole numbers and rates, as the numbers they were checked as, int64 where a
whole-number column has no blank and float64 otherwise, and `joint` as the flags it was
checked as, which is what the projection reads. A frequency other than 12, 4, 2 or 1, and
a text column outside its categories, pass `Data` and are refused by the cell that decodes
them, with `DIA_US_S`'s message, wherever the model first reads them (`invalid frequency`,
`invalid income_form`, …).

A point at or past the stop rule, `duration_mth ≥ stop_mth()`, reads, but `proj_len()`
refuses it, naming the point. So does a contract in force that owes nothing after the
valuation date because every covered life has died, with one message for each way it can:
before the income start month, its death benefit, if any, paid; after it, with its certain
period over; or on a form with no certain period, its refund, if any, paid at the last
death. Such a contract made its last payment before the valuation date, and an in-force
extract should not carry it; it is `Term_US_SEC`'s point past its cover, for a product whose
cover can end with a death. The rule needs the certain period, which an installment refund
derives from the payout schedule, so it is the product's rule and not the table's. A
contract inside its guarantee with every covered life dead pays the beneficiary, and
projects: point 20 with its life at 0 still pays 2,259.69 at `t = 0`.

`proj_len()` also refuses, naming the point, one combination of the two payout options,
which neither model prices: an acceleration on the books, at or after the valuation date,
whose lump sum pulls forward instalments of a guarantee that a commutation before it has
reduced. The lump sum pays each instalment it pulls forward at the payment factor,
unreduced, as `DIA_US_S`'s does, so the cohort that commuted would be paid those
instalments again: `DIA_US_S`'s point 15 accelerating six months after its full
commutation pays 8,282.92 in the exercise month, 7,805.70 of it instalments the cohort
commuted, and its commutation check fails. The guarantee's end needs the certain period,
so this too is the product's rule. An acceleration that pulls forward only the
life-contingent instalments after the guarantee projects, and so does one paid before the
valuation date.

A loop over the block meets a refused row only when it reaches it, after projecting the
points before it, so `run_sec.py --block` asks every point for its frame before it projects
any, and stops before it prints anything.

## The premium schedule

A deferred income annuity takes any number of premiums during its deferral [S2] [S3] [S4]
[R13], so `DIA_US_S` reads a contract's premiums from a long table, `premium_schedule.csv`,
one row per premium slice, matched to its point by `point_id`. That file knows
`DIA_US_S`'s seventeen points alone, and a point with no rows projects silently, with no
premium and no income: point 1 copied under a new `point_id` totals −1,985.46 in `net_cf`,
its expenses, against point 1's −277,363.94.

So `DIA_US_SEC` reads its own, `premium_schedule_sec.csv`, through the same reader's
Reference, `Data.premium_schedule_file`. It has `DIA_US_S`'s columns — `point_id`, `slice`,
`premium_mth`, the policy month at whose start the premium is paid, `premium_amt`, the
amount per contract, and `provenance` — and nothing but `point_id` names a point. It holds
the premiums **still due** at the valuation date:

- for a twin, `DIA_US_S`'s rows as they stand. The file opens with `premium_schedule.csv`,
  in its order, so that a twin's `premium_schedule()` is `DIA_US_S`'s, row labels and all;
- for a point in force, the premiums of policy months `duration_mth` and later: those paid
  before are in its opening state, in `cum_premium_pp_init` and, through the slices they
  bought, `annual_income_init`. Point 18, in force 59 months, holds the 50,000 of policy
  month 60, and points 19 to 25, past their last premium, hold none;
- for a point issued later, its whole schedule: point 26 holds point 8's two premiums, at
  policy months 0 and 60.

Premium months stay policy months. No row is typed by hand: the file is generated with the
table, from `DIA_US_S`'s schedule, by the same spec (*The model points*, below), and the
tests regenerate it and compare. `Data.premium_schedule_table()` checks it as it reads it,
against the model point table as checked, and the first check that fails raises
`ValueError`, naming the column, the label or every point at fault:

- the `point_id`, `premium_mth` and `premium_amt` columns are present;
- each `point_id` is a whole number, a model point's label, below `2**53` in size, which
  an int64 holds exactly, and labels a point of the model point table;
- each `premium_mth` is a whole number of months, 0 or more, read by value, so that `60.0`
  is 60, where `DIA_US_S` takes `int()` of the raw month, so that `60.5` is 60 there and
  text raises Python's own message, and below `2**53`;
- each `premium_amt` is a number, zero or more;
- no premium falls before the valuation date on a point in force: those paid are in its
  opening state;
- no premium falls at or after the income start month in force. The product takes none
  within 13 months of the income start date [S2] [S4], and the payout schedule rests on an
  income level from that month on (*Pricing on the policy clock*), as `DIA_US_S`'s refund
  base, `CP(T)`, does, which a premium after it would leave out;
- every point buys an income: a point with no income bought by the valuation date,
  `annual_income_init` 0, has a positive premium due. `DIA_US_S`'s silent case is refused,
  naming the point.

The table is returned with `point_id` and `premium_mth` as integers and `premium_amt` as
floats, the numbers checked. `premium_schedule()` and `premium_by_mth()` keep `DIA_US_S`'s
formulas, for a reader and for the comparison with `DIA_US_S`. The projection reads the
same premiums from `Data.premium_array()`, the schedule summed by policy month as
`premium_by_mth()` sums it (*The compiled model*, below), through `premium_pm(k)`, the
premium of policy month `k`, and the pricing kernel's fixed point sums them on a contract
issued at or after the valuation date.

## The model points

No row of `model_point_table_sec.csv` or `premium_schedule_sec.csv` is typed by hand. Every
one is generated from `DIA_US_S`, its table and its premium schedule by
`tests/sec_support.py`, from the `DIA_US_SEC` entry in its `SEC_SPECS`, and the tests
regenerate both files and compare, so an edit to a `DIA_US_S` row reaches them or fails the
suite. In the source repository, `python tools/gen_sec_points.py DIA_US_SEC` writes them.

| Point | Kind | From | At the valuation date |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–17 | twin | S points 1–17 | issued at `t = 0`: `DIA_US_S`'s worked example and its two readings, the death-benefit fork, every payout form, both joint triggers, the COLA, two QLACs, the three options, generational mortality and advance timing |
| 18 | derived | S point 14 at S month 59 | the payment-acceleration contract in its deferral, the month before its second premium: 100,000 paid, 32,024.03 a year bought, `n_g` 40.810288; the 50,000 due at `t = 1` takes the income to 44,106.53 |
| 19 | derived | S point 1 at S month 241 | the anchor cell a month into its income phase, its cash refund running: a refund balance of 146,311.70 at `t = 0` |
| 20 | derived | S point 7 at S month 300 | the 10-year period certain with 60 certain months left: the floor pays the cohort that reached the income phase, 0.715, the lives being 0.5577 |
| 21 | derived | S point 15 at S month 253 | the month after its 100% commutation: 79.54 a month, the beneficiaries' residual, to policy month 359, and the life tail, 919.16, from `t = 107` |
| 22 | derived | S point 13 at S month 121 | the month after its start-date adjustment: an income of 82,907.43, the repricing by 1.8797 included, from policy month 300, `t = 179` |
| 23 | derived | S point 8 at S month 672 | the joint contract with its joint annuitant dead with certainty since policy month 661: lives 4.25e-05 and 0, the survivor's two thirds paid from `t = 0` |
| 24 | derived | S point 5 at S month 270 | the installment refund inside its derived period, 11 of its 41 certain months left |
| 25 | derived | S point 1 at S month 719 | the anchor cell in its last month, a one-row frame: the life at 6.13e-08 |
| 26 | future | S point 8, 13 months on | issued at `t = 13`, its premiums at `t = 13` and `t = 73` |

A derived row's opening state is what `DIA_US_S` carries into its month `d`, each column
read as `DIA_US_S`'s own formulas read it: each life's survival to time `d`,
`lives_if(d, life)`, before month `d`'s deaths; the premiums paid and the income bought
entering month `d`, `DIA_US_S`'s `cum_premium_pp(d − 1)` and `annual_income(d − 1)`, which
hold that month's premium; on a refund form, `DIA_US_S`'s `guarantee_mths_pricing()`;
`l_last(T)`, `DIA_US_S`'s `surv_to_payout()`, where `T` precedes `d`, and `l_last(t_c)`
where the commutation month does; and the reference rate's change since issue,
`DIA_US_S`'s `ref_rate_shift`, which it applies from month 0 on, so that a row restated at
`d` has seen all of it, 0 on every shipped row, as `ref_rate_shift` ships. Its
`policy_count` is `DIA_US_S`'s `pols_if_init()`, the contracts the point stands for, and
not `DIA_US_S`'s `pols_if(d)`, which is weighted by survival: the survival is in the life
columns. So the row continues the S projection from there. Its `policy_id` is the S row's
with the month appended, `DIA-000014-M59`, and a future row's carries the months to issue,
`DIA-000008-F13`. Row `t` of a generated point is month `t + source_mth` of its S point,
and its premium schedule holds, under its own `point_id`, the S point's premiums of months
`d` and later. All 26 are at issue age 60 and, where joint, 63, as `DIA_US_S`'s points
are. The mortality table and the improvement scale carry ages 20 to 120, every issue age the
product allows, but the two factor tables carry a handful of keys, so a point on the table
basis at another age, sex, form or deferral needs them extended first.

## Counts and timings

`pols_if_init()` is the count in force at the valuation date: `policy_count` for a point
already in force, 0 for any other. `pols_new_biz(t)` is `policy_count` in the issue month,
the month with `duration_mth(t) = 0`, and 0 in every other: new business in
`basiclife/BasicTerm_SE`'s sense, a contract entering the books, which brings its premium
schedule and no acquisition cost, as in `DIA_US_S`, which has none.
`pols_if_at(t, timing)` has two timings, `basiclife/BasicTerm_SE`'s:

- `BEF_NB`, the contracts carried in from month `t − 1`, before month `t`'s new business:
  `pols_if_init()` at `t_entry()`, the first month on the books, and the whole
  `policy_count` after it, to the stop rule;
- `BEF_DECR`, that count plus `pols_new_biz(t)`, which weights every cash flow of month
  `t`.

Any other timing raises. **The count is not decremented.** `DIA_US_S` weights every flow by
its constant `pols_if_init()` and carries mortality in each life's `lives_if`, and this
model does the same on the count on the books: every cash flow is
`pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)` times an amount per contract weighted by survival, the premium
by `l_last(t)`, the income by the payment factor, the death benefit and the refund by the
last-death density. So `BEF_NB` is a closed form, the same float that a recursion
`BEF_NB(t − 1) + pols_new_biz(t − 1)`, as `Term_US_SEC`'s, would give, with no chain of
calls behind it. The count leaves the books only at the stop rule:
`pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR) − pols_if_at(t + 1, BEF_NB)` is 0 at every `t` of every frame
but the last, where it is the whole count, at the end of the last projected month.
`DIA_US_S` has no maturity, and neither has this model. This is `SPIA_US_SEC`'s count, the
payout chassis', carried back into the deferral.

`pols_if(t)` keeps `DIA_US_S`'s definition, on the count on the books:
`pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR) × lives_if_last(t)`, the contracts weighted by the probability
that a covered life is alive at the start of month `t`, `DIA_US_S`'s
`pols_if_init() × l_last(t)` bit for bit on every twin. It carries the maintenance expense,
which the notes weight by `l(t)`, where the payout chassis weights it by
`max(C(t), l_alive(t))`. It is not the count before decrements, which mortality never
moves: on point 20, the 10-year period certain in force 300 months, `pols_if(0)` is 0.5577
against a count of 1, as `DIA_US_S`'s `pols_if(300)` is. Nor is it `SPIA_US_SEC`'s closing
measure. So the registry marks the model `survival_pols_if`, a key of its own, and the
convention every other `_SEC` model but `SPIA_US_SEC` meets,
`pols_if(t) = pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)`, skips it; the conventions suite confines the key
to `DIA_US_SEC`, as it confines `closing_pols_if` to `SPIA_US_SEC`. The count on the books
is not a column of `result_pols()`: it is the table's `policy_count`, from issue to the stop
rule.

**`pols_new_biz`, and no lapse.** `DIA_US_S`'s tests forbid every name that looks like a
lapse decrement, a surrender charge or an account value: the contract has none, VM-22
declaring its standard-projection lapse section not applicable to contracts with no
account value or surrender benefit [R9]. `pols_new_biz` is not among them, and here it
means only a contract entering the books. The model has no `pols_lapse`, no `lapse_rate`,
no surrender value and no account value.

Cover is `is_active(t)`, `0 ≤ duration_mth(t) < stop_mth()`, and outside it, before issue
and from the stop rule on, every count is zero, and so every cash flow. No count evaluates
a rate there, and no cell reads a policy year or an attained age the contract does not
have: `is_payout`, `is_payment_mth` and `accel_blackout` are false, `cola_factor` is 1, and
the premium, the cumulative premium, the income, the mortality and improvement rates, the
deaths, the scheduled instalment, the certain floor, the payment factors, the refund
balance, the commuted fraction, the commutation's weight and value, the acceleration's
weight and the death and refund claims are zero before any table or schedule is read.
`lives_if` and `lives_if_last` are zero before the contract is on the books.

Four chains of calls run back a cell a month, as in `DIA_US_S`: the projection's survival,
`lives_if`, and the premiums paid and the income bought, `cum_premium_pp` and
`annual_income`, each to `t_entry()`; and on a refund form the instalments scheduled to
date, `cum_annuity_pp`, to the policy month before the valuation month, or to the income
start month if that is later. The longest sets how deep a cold call runs, counted as
modelx's stack trace counts it; `mx.set_recursion` admits a call one level deeper than the
limit it is given. A cold `net_cf` in the last month of the anchor's 720-month frame, point
1, runs 731 cells deep, 719 of them `lives_if`, against 729 in `DIA_US_S` and 728 before
compiling, which added three cells at the chain's foot, where the first month's rate reads
the life's schedule in the mortality table, through `Data`'s vector and the table's
numbering; on the cash refund in payout 241 months, point 19, 490 deep, 479 of them
`cum_annuity_pp`; and on point 26, issued 13 months on, 731 again, because its chains stop
at `t_entry()`. Every committed point runs one cell a month back to `t_entry()` and 7 to 12
more, and point 25's one-row frame 15 cells in all. At the longest cover the model
projects, 1,440 months from issue age 0, the youngest the compiled model's caches are
sized for (*The compiled model*, below), with the income from policy month 360, on age
tables extended to age 0, it runs 1,451 cells deep on a cash refund and on a joint contract
issued at 0 and 0, and 1,446 on an installment refund, at the valuation date and issued 120
months on alike, and 1,451 on a period certain and on the advance-timing twin at the
valuation date; and 1,447 on an installment
refund in advance issued 120 months on whose income starts at the age stop, policy month
1,440, whose refund period, rounded up to a whole instalment, ends a month past it, a frame
of 1,561 months. Each report evaluates its columns in ascending `t`, and a sweep of the
committed points that way, every report and check, runs at most 17 cells deep, on the
installment refund's twin, point 5, a recursion limit of 16. The figures count the count
cell each table's join asks first. In the model's export, `model.export()`, which runs the
cells as Python functions, about two frames a cell, the cold call in the last month needs
a Python recursion limit of 1,484 on the anchor's twin and on point 26, 1,459 on the
installment refund's twin, 1,002 on point 19 and 2,924 at the longest cover, 2,899 on the
installment refund and 2,901 on the one in advance; and the ascending sweep needs 48 on the
committed points read in order, and 64 where the installment refund's twin, or the longest
cover's, is the first point read, `Data`'s first reads among its frames.

## The opening state

`DIA_US_S` projects every contract from issue, with each covered life alive, nothing paid,
no income bought and the reference rate where it stood at issue. A contract valued in force
needs what those have become by the valuation date. Read cell by cell, `DIA_US_S`'s
recursions carry three quantities along the contract's life — survival per life, the
cumulative premium and the income — which are four state columns, and one that follows from
the contract's terms alone, the instalments scheduled to date, which needs none. Three more
cannot be re-derived at the valuation date: the guarantee period the kernel prices with, a
fixed point over the whole premium schedule, which the premiums still due cannot recover,
and the two cohort weights `DIA_US_S` reads at a fixed past instant, `l_last(T)` and
`l_last(t_c)`, which the lives at the valuation date cannot say. And one input is a
point-to-point quantity on a market path that began before `t = 0`, the reference rate's
change since issue, whose value at the valuation date is the eighth column. The rows show
each, with what it gives when the column is wrong:

- **Survival per life.** Each life column opens `lives_if` at `t_entry()`, and from there
  the monthly rate decrements it, as in `DIA_US_S`. Point 23, the joint contract in force
  672 months, opens with lives 4.25e-05 and 0, its joint annuitant, aged 118 at policy month
  660, having died there with certainty, the shipped rate being 1 at that age. On the
  *either* trigger it pays two thirds of the instalment weighted by the primary's survival
  from `t = 0`: a payment factor of 2.56e-05, `0.666667 × lives_if(1, 1)`. Point 25 opens
  with its life at 6.13e-08, in the last month of its frame.
- **The premiums paid and the income bought.** Point 18 opens in its deferral with 100,000
  paid and 32,024.03 a year bought. Its premium still due, 50,000 at policy month 60, is
  received at `t = 1` weighted by survival to that month, the notes' five-year anchor of
  0.975, so 48,750.00, and buys income at `DIA_US_S`'s purchase rate for policy month 60,
  taking `B` to 44,106.53 and `CP` to 150,000, `DIA_US_S`'s figures. Point 22 opens with
  82,907.43 a year, the 44,106.53 its premiums bought repriced by 1.8797 when its income
  start date was deferred five years at policy month 120: the repricing is in the column,
  and the model does not run it again. Point 19 opens in payout with 150,000 paid, the
  refund base: its refund balance at `t = 0` is
  `150,000 − G(240) = 150,000 − 3,688.30 = 146,311.70`.
- **The guarantee period the kernel prices with.** Point 18, a cash refund, carries
  `n_g` = 40.810288 months, `DIA_US_S`'s fixed point over both its slices, and its slice
  still due is priced with it, at `DIA_US_S`'s purchase rate to the last bit. With the
  column at 0 the slice would buy income to 44,455.74; recomputed over the premiums still
  due alone, the 50,000 slice, the fixed point would be 50.351006 months, and the income
  43,940.38. Neither is `DIA_US_S`'s.
- **The cohort that reached the income phase.** Point 20, the 10-year period certain in
  force 300 months, has 60 certain months left. Its floor pays the instalment of 3,160.41
  at `surv_to_payout_init`, 0.715, so 2,259.69 a month through `t = 59`, while
  `lives_if_last(0)` is 0.5577: the difference is the guarantee running on to the
  beneficiaries of contracts whose annuitant has died. At the life value, 0.5577, the
  floor would pay 1,762.56 a month, 29,827.97 less over the 60 months; from `t = 60`, policy
  month 360, both pay the life-contingent instalment, 1,265.95. Point 24, the installment
  refund with 11 of its 41 derived certain months left, pays 2,628.01 at the same 0.715
  through `t = 10`, and 2,208.48 on the life from `t = 11`.
- **The cohort that commuted.** Point 21, a month after its 100% commutation at policy
  month 252, carries `commute_weight_init` 0.680338 beside `surv_to_payout_init` 0.715. It
  pays the beneficiaries' residual, `2,294.65 × (0.715 − 0.680338) = 79.54` a month, through
  policy month 359, 8,510.40 in all, and the life tail, 919.16, from `t = 107`, policy month
  360, each `DIA_US_S`'s figure. With the column at 0.715 it would pay nothing before
  `t = 107`: the commutation would extinguish the guarantee of the contracts whose
  annuitant died between the income start month and the exercise, which could not have
  commuted.
- **The reference rate's change since issue.** The commutation discount rate is
  `i_c = i_p + max(0, r_ref(t) − r_ref(0)) + m_c`, `0` the issue date: the pricing rate,
  4.75%, plus the reference rate's rise since issue, floored at 0, plus a 50 bp margin
  **[std]**. `DIA_US_S` reads the change from one Reference, `ref_rate_shift`, and every one
  of its points is issued at its own `t = 0`, so one value fits them all. Contracts in force
  at a valuation date were issued at different dates and have seen different changes, which
  no one value holds. So every contract of a block reads the change on one path of the
  reference rate, which every point shares, each from its own issue date. A contract on the
  books at the valuation date, in force or issued then, has seen `ref_rate_shift_init` by
  that date, and sees `ref_rate_shift`, the change made at the valuation date, from month 0
  on, as `DIA_US_S`'s contract sees its `ref_rate_shift` from issue: its rate is
  `i_p + max(0, ref_rate_shift_init() + ref_rate_shift) + m_c`, the two parts added before
  the floor, so that a fall before the valuation date offsets a rise at it. A contract
  issued later is bought after the change and has seen none of it, so its rate is
  `i_p + m_c`. The column ships at 0 on every row, as `ref_rate_shift` does, and no
  committed row in force is valued before its commutation; the tests add the rows. Point 15
  restated at policy month 240, twelve months before its commutation, with the column at
  0.005, discounts at 5.75%, its commuted value 195,192.02, `DIA_US_S`'s point 15's with its
  `ref_rate_shift` at 0.005, while in the same read its twin, issued at the valuation date,
  discounts at 5.25%, its commuted value 199,020.42, `DIA_US_S`'s on the shipped 0, and so
  does the same contract issued 13 months later. With `ref_rate_shift` at 0.005, the
  reference rate up 50 basis points more at the valuation date, the first discounts at
  6.25%, 191,483.27, `DIA_US_S`'s at 0.01, and the twin at 5.75%, while the contract issued
  later, bought after the rise, still discounts at 5.25%. With the column at −0.01 and the
  Reference at 0.005 the first discounts at 5.25%, and with the column at 0.01 and the
  Reference at −0.005 at 5.75%, where a floor on each part would give 5.75% and 6.25%. The
  rate is level: it reads neither clock. A path of the reference rate would be another input
  table, read on the valuation clock, each contract taking the change on it from the later
  of its issue date and the valuation date.

**The instalments scheduled to date** need no column. `cum_annuity_pp(k)`, the notes'
`G(k)`, is the instalments scheduled through the end of policy month `k`, from the income
start month: a deterministic as-if-alive schedule, fixed by the income there, the COLA, the
frequency and the timing, which a cash refund nets on death and an installment refund
searches for its derived period. It stays on the policy clock, keyed as `DIA_US_S` keys it,
and only its recursion's base moves: at the policy month before the valuation month, or
before issue on a contract issued later, `max(duration_mth_init(), 0) − 1`, a key the model
point fixes, one loop sums the instalments scheduled from the income start month to it,
the same additions in the same order as the recursion, so `G` is `DIA_US_S`'s to the last
bit, and a later key recurses back to that one, a month at a time. Point 19 reads
`G(240) = 3,688.30` at `t = 0`, and its `result_cf()` on a fresh read evaluates `G` at
keys 240 to 718 alone, where `DIA_US_S`'s `G` recurses back to issue. That base serves the
refund balance, the one other reader of `G`. An installment refund's derived period,
`n_R`, is a fixed point of the whole payout schedule, which its stop rule needs, so
`certain_mths_refund()` searches `G` upward from the income start month, a cell deep at
each key: point 24, valued 30 months into its income phase, reads `G` at keys 240 to 280,
the end of its derived period, and at no other. A cash refund asks for no key before the
valuation date's.

**The acceleration's weight** needs no column either. `DIA_US_S` pays the five instalments
pulled forward in the exercise month at the survival of that month, and reads the weight
there alone. Point 18, valued before its acceleration, pays its lump sum at `t = 193`; a
contract valued in its blackout or later paid the lump sum before the valuation date, and
its blackout months pay nothing, which the policy clock decides. `accel_payment_factor(t)`
is `DIA_US_S`'s weight in a blackout month whose exercise is on the books, and 0 where the
lump sum was paid before the valuation date; no projection cell calls it.

**The certain months left** need no column: `certain_floor(t)` is
`1{0 ≤ duration_mth(t) − T < n_eff}` on the policy clock, and the effective certain period
`n_eff` is fixed at the income start month: the elected one, or an installment refund's,
which `certain_mths_refund()` derives from the payout schedule.

## Pricing on the policy clock

`DIA_US_S` uses one survival curve, `lives_if`, for two jobs: pricing each premium's paid-up
slice at its own date, and projecting. On the valuation clock the two part. The projection's
survival, `lives_if(t, life)`, opens at the valuation date from the life columns. Pricing
stays anchored at issue and at the premium dates, deterministic from the contract's terms,
whatever the valuation date: `lives_if_pm(k, life)`, the probability that a life survives
from issue to the policy time point `k`, is one explicit loop from issue over the monthly
rates, `DIA_US_S`'s recursion unrolled, the same products in the same order, so it is
`DIA_US_S`'s `lives_if(k, life)` to the last bit, at every key of all seventeen twins. The
rate comes from one place, `mort_rate_py(y, life)`, the annual rate of policy year `y`,
whose attained age and calendar year are the year's, and `mort_rate_mth_py(y, life)`, its
monthly rate. The projection's `mort_rate(t, life)` is `mort_rate_py` at the policy year of
month `t`, so the two curves use one rate, as `DIA_US_S`'s one curve did. So pricing shares
the valuation's mortality basis, its A/E and its improvement, as `DIA_US_S`'s does: a
mortality sensitivity moves the purchase rate of every premium still due, and every twin's
and future row's guarantee period and income, while a contract in force keeps the guarantee
period it was priced with, `guarantee_mths_pricing_init`. At an A/E of 0.9, point 18's slice
still due buys 0.229129 a year per dollar rather than 0.241650, taking its income to
43,480.50, while its column keeps the 40.810288 months priced at the shipped 1.0; the twin
of point 14 prices with 43.352185 months and buys 41,520.40.

Every pricing cell is keyed by the premium's or the exercise's policy month `k`,
`DIA_US_S`'s `t` renamed: `income_start_mth_at`, `deferral_yrs`, `surv_to_income_start`,
`rop_factor_calc`, `rop_factor`, `annuity_factor_def` and `purchase_rate`.
`annuity_factor` keeps `DIA_US_S`'s arguments, policy months with a rate and a guarantee,
and carries the survival forward from its start month in one pass; the projection reads it
on each set of arguments `DIA_US_S` passes it as `annuity_factor_at(k, basis)`, the same
body keyed by integers (*The compiled model*, below). `adjust_income_factor` and
`accel_cost` price at the exercise's policy month on the same curve. So a premium still
due at the valuation date is priced as `DIA_US_S` prices it: point 18's 50,000 at policy
month 60 buys 0.241650 of income a year per dollar, `DIA_US_S`'s `purchase_rate(60)` bit for
bit. The kernel reads the curve at a handful of keys: on the anchor's twin at policy months
0, 60 and 240, its two premium months and `T`; on point 18, priced on the formula basis, at
60, 120, 180 and 240, its slice still due and the five-year bands of its return-of-premium
factor; and on a contract past its last premium, none. Pricing never reads the projection,
so a cold `net_cf(0)` runs 16 cells deep on the anchor's twin, on point 13's and on point
18, 15 on the points in payout, 24 on the installment refund's twin, point 5, through its
refund-period search, and 8 on point 26, issued later, once `Data`'s table is read, where
`DIA_US_S`'s runs 251 on points 1 and 5 and 311 on point 13, recursing through survival to
the income start month.

**The payout schedule is fixed at the income start month.** Five things read the income
ahead of `t`: the installment refund's search for its derived period, which the stop rule
reads, the refund balance, the commuted value, the acceleration's lump sum and the realized
guarantee period, `guarantee_yrs()`. On the valuation clock the income `B` and the
cumulative premium `CP` are recursions, `annual_income(t)` and `cum_premium_pp(t)`, and
reading them far ahead would open a chain as long as the deferral. So
`annual_income_payout()`, `B(T)`, is `annual_income_init()`, then one loop over the policy
months from the valuation date's to `T`, applying the repricing at the exercise month and
adding each premium's slice at its purchase rate, the recursion's operations in its order;
and `cum_premium_payout()`, `CP(T)`, the refund base, is `cum_premium_pp_init()` plus the
same loop's premiums. Each is `DIA_US_S`'s `annual_income(T)` and `cum_premium_pp(T)` to the
last bit on every twin, and on a contract past its income start month the loop is empty and
both are the opening state. `annuity_pp_sched_pm(k)`, the instalment of policy month `k`,
is `B(T)/m` times the COLA of its payout year, and `cum_annuity_pp(k)` sums it (*The opening
state*). This rests on `B` being level from `T` on, which the product guarantees — no
premium within 13 months of the income start date [S2] [S4], the adjustment exercised in the
deferral — and which `DIA_US_S` assumes without checking: its refund base is `CP(T)` while
its instalments read `B(t)`, so a premium after `T` would raise the instalments and not the
refund base. `Data` refuses a premium at or after `T`, and an adjustment whose new start
month is not after its exercise.

## Departures from DIA_US_S

Each formula that tested `t` against a contractual event now tests the policy clock, each
read of a schedule at a month is a read by policy month, every recursion on the valuation
clock begins at `t_entry()`, and pricing has a survival curve of its own. Of `DIA_US_S`'s
113 `Projection` cells, 26 are unchanged, 24 have a new docstring only and 63 are
rewritten, and 36 cells are new, 149 in all. Of its seven `Data` cells, `input_dir` and the
four readers of `DIA_US_S`'s assumption tables are unchanged, and the readers of this
model's two files, `model_point_table` and `premium_schedule_table`, are rewritten; `Data`
gains four count cells, one beside each assumption table's reader, `model_point_file` and
`premium_schedule_file` name this model's two files, and `Data` gains one Reference,
`future_horizon_mth`. None is removed or renamed, which the twin identity asserts: a cell
of `DIA_US_S`'s that this model lacked would fail it. Compiling then changed how each cell
reads its inputs and spells its codes, and no number: it added five cells to `Projection`,
`point_id`, `mort_schedule`, `improvement_schedule`, `annuity_factor_at` and
`rop_deferral_yrs`, 154 in all, and 82 to `Data`, 93 in all (*The compiled model*, below);
of `DIA_US_S`'s cells it changed the signature of two, `claims` and `claims_ann`, whose
kind is no longer optional, the code `ALL` standing for `DIA_US_S`'s `None`, which the twin
identity compares with `DIA_US_S`'s `claims(t, None)` and `claims_ann(y, None)`; and the
decodes, the factor tables' joins and the premiums read `Data`'s vectors and arrays, not
the model point and the tables. `Projection`'s `point_id` Reference gave way to `idx`; the
codes and `issue_age_min` are new References, and so are `Data`'s `premium_last_mth` and
`np`.

The other new cells are `policy_count`, `duration_mth_init`, `t_entry`, `is_active`,
`pols_if_at`, `pols_new_biz`, `mort_rate_mth_py`, the pricing curve's monthly rate, and
three opening-state accessors, `lives_if_init(life)`, `cum_premium_pp_init` and
`annual_income_init`.

`Data`'s two readers of this model's own files check them (*The in-force interface*, *The
premium schedule*). Its four readers of `DIA_US_S`'s assumption tables, read in place, are
`DIA_US_S`'s, unchanged, and a count cell beside each checks its table once, before any
value is read: `mort_table_count`, `improvement_scale_count`, `payout_factor_count` and
`rop_factor_count`, each the table's rows, an int. Each reads its table's keys by value, as
the join matches them, so that an age written `70.0` is 70, and refuses, naming the file,
the column and the lines at fault: a key that is blank, text or not whole; a sex other than
`M` or `F`, or a payout form other than `LO`, `CR`, `IR` or `PC`, which no join reads; a
key on two rows; and, on the mortality table and the improvement scale, read at every age
from a life's issue age, a gap in a sex's ages. It refuses a value that is blank, text or
infinite, or outside its table's range — a mortality rate below 0, an improvement rate of 1
or more, a payout factor of 0 or less, a return-of-premium factor below 0 — because through
survival and the purchase rates it reaches a floor that would lose it: the refund balance's
`max(0, ·)` and the payment factor's `max`, where `max(0.0, nan)` is 0.0; mortality's cap,
with its bound second, keeps a NaN until then. A mortality rate above 1 is accepted, and
capped, and so is a negative improvement rate, a deterioration, which the generational
basis projects as `DIA_US_S` does. Each join, `mort_rate_base_at`, `improvement_rate_at`,
`payout_factor` and `rop_factor`, asks its table's count before it reads a value, so a
projection meets the checks first. A key a point needs that the table lacks still raises
where `DIA_US_S`'s does.

`Data` also refuses, naming the point, what `DIA_US_S` projects without a word or
inconsistently: a premium at or after the income start month, which the product does not
accept and which, after it, would raise the instalments and not the refund base; an
adjustment with one of its two months blank, which `DIA_US_S` ignores or turns into an
income start month of −1, or with a new start month not after the exercise; an acceleration
or a commutation before the income start month, where `DIA_US_S`'s commutation weight
exceeds the payment factor and its expected instalment goes negative; a point that buys no
income; a joint contract on the table basis, which `DIA_US_S` refuses only when a premium is
priced, naming no point; an integer column that is not whole, which `DIA_US_S` reads with
`int()`, so that 60.5 is 60 and text raises Python's own message; a blank, text or
out-of-range value in the columns a `max` or a comparison reads; a start-date adjustment
exercised at or after the income start month it moves, which pays nothing from that month
to the exercise; an acceleration and a commutation within six months of each other, the
product's interlock, where `DIA_US_S`'s commuted value counts the instalments the lump sum
has paid; a `joint` flag other than `True` or `False`, which `DIA_US_S`'s `bool()` reads
as `True` whatever the text; a sex other than `M` or `F`; and a frozen weight of 0, which
on a contract whose lives have all died zeroes the guarantee it still owes. And
`proj_len()` refuses an acceleration whose lump sum pulls forward instalments of a
guarantee a commutation has reduced, which both models pay unreduced. Each is a recorded
departure: `DIA_US_S` projects such a point.

Of the cash flows, the change of clock moves the maintenance expense alone, and
`liability_cf` and `net_cf` with it. A contract in force carries that expense in
valuation-date dollars, and its steps fall on the valuation date's anniversaries rather
than the contract's, so point 19's `expenses(t)` is `DIA_US_S`'s `expenses(241 + t)`
divided by `1.025^20`, about 1.639, in some months and by `1.025^21` in others. Its other
cash flows and its counts are `DIA_US_S`'s from its month 241 on. Point 26 is `DIA_US_S`'s
point 8 thirteen months on in those columns too, its premiums included, and its maintenance
expense is `DIA_US_S`'s times 1.025 or `1.025^2`.

## The compiled model

The model compiles under modelx-cython into C-typed code, as `basiclife/BasicTerm_SC` does,
and modelx reads and runs the same formulas as before. Compiling changed how each cell
reads its inputs and spells its codes, and no number: what the model computed on each
committed point was frozen before the change, and it still computes it (*Tests*, below).
Cell by cell, at every argument a full modelx sweep evaluates, the compiled model computes
what modelx computes, bit for bit, on the committed points and on the points of the splice
grid, which take the branches they do not. The compile tests hold it so on x86-64, and to
1e-12 relative elsewhere, where no run has shown it yet.

### Building it

In the source repository:

```bash
python tools/build_sec_cy.py deferred_income_annuity             # in place, beside it
python tools/build_sec_cy.py deferred_income_annuity --out /tmp/dia  # elsewhere
```

The tool exports the model to `DIA_US_SEC_nomx/`, the Python package modelx's `export`
writes, which runs without modelx. It copies the CSVs beside the export when it builds
anywhere but here, because the package reads the CSVs of the directory that holds it. It
then runs mx2cy, modelx-cython's compiler, on the export, with `sample_sec.py` and
`spec_sec.py` (below). The result is `DIA_US_SEC_nomx_cy/`, whose spaces are C extension
types, and it is imported as the export is:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "products/deferred_income_annuity")   # the directory holding the build
from DIA_US_SEC_nomx_cy import mx_model as model
model.Projection[18].result_cf()                          # point 19, compiled
```

Compiled, no cache is ever cleared. An ItemSpace takes the References when it is made, and
keeps the values it computes until it is deleted; the base `Projection` and `Data` keep
theirs for good. So `Projection.idx = 18` after `Projection.result_cf()` leaves point 1's
720-row frame cached, while `point_id()`, not yet computed, reads point 19's label, and
`Projection.expense_maint` set to 90 once `Projection[0]` has computed point 1's
`expenses(0)` leaves it at 4.17, 50 a year over twelve months, where an ItemSpace made
after, `Projection[1]`, computes 7.50 for point 2's. Set every Reference on a model just
imported, before anything is computed, where modelx would recompute; a test holds the
compiled model to this.

A build takes about 53 s here, with MSVC, and needs a C compiler, which is why
`requirements.txt` leaves modelx-cython out: `pip install -r requirements-cython.txt`.
`run_sec.py --cython` builds in place when it finds no build, or one older than the model,
the sample, the spec or the tool, and `--build DIR` runs a build made with `--out DIR`.
Nothing a build writes is committed. All of it derives from committed files, and an
extension module is built for one operating system, processor and Python
(`_mx_classes.cp313-win_amd64.pyd` here); in place, `.gitignore` covers all of it. A
`lifelib.create()` copy of the library carries no `tools/`, so it cannot build, and
`run_sec.py --cython` says so.

### What compiling changed, and why

A compiled cell is fast when its body is C, and types alone do not make it so. Compiled by
the same tool, with a sample of its own, as it stood after running in force, the model typed
132 of its 149 `Projection` cells as C numbers. Four took a timing or a kind as text,
`pols_if_at`, `claim_pp`, `claims_ann` and `claims`, whose kind could be `None`, and those
four, `phase`, which returned text, `sex`, a label, and the pricing kernel's
`annuity_factor` and `pricing_disc_factor`, which take floats, kept a dictionary for a
cache. The bodies of the typed cells still called pandas and Python: a `model_point()`
lookup for each attribute a formula reads, in 46 cells; text compared in each decode;
`pd.isna` on each option month, the commuted fraction and the rounding convention; a
`.loc` on a table for each
attained age's mortality and improvement and each payout and return-of-premium factor; and
the premium schedule filtered, sorted and turned into a dictionary by `iterrows` for each
point, then read by `dict.get`. It ran 1.9 times its own export, 7.51 ms a point on
`net_cf` against 14.0, over the committed points once `Data` had read them, the fastest of
three runs, on a build of the stage-`E` model with a sample and a spec of its own, which
are not shipped. So each input now reaches a cell as a number:

- **`idx`.** `Projection` is parameterized by the position of a point in the table, from
  0, as `BasicTerm_SC` is: `Projection[18]` is point 19, and `point_id()` returns the
  label, which every refusal names. The position is what indexes the vectors below.
- **`Data`'s vectors.** Each model point column a formula uses is a `Data` vector of
  int64 or float64, one element a point, named as the column, and a cell reads its point's
  element as stage `E` read the point's value: `cola_rate()` is
  `float(data.cola_rate()[idx])`, an age or a month is `int()` of its element. Compiled,
  the vector is a typed memoryview, and the read is a load from memory. Where a point's
  value can be one its projection cannot use, a 0/1 vector beside it, `issue_age_ok()` and
  the like, says whether it is usable, and the accessor refuses the point where it reads
  the element (*What it refuses*, below). A blank option month, which `DIA_US_S` reads as
  never through `pd.isna`, is −1 in its vector, as `DIA_US_S` returns it, and a blank
  `purchase_rate_dp`, full precision, is −1 too, `DIA_US_S`'s own sentinel.
- **Text, decoded once.** A C cell holds no text, so `Data` decodes each text column a
  formula branches on into 0/1 flags, for every point at once: the form into
  `is_life_only`, `is_cash_refund`, `is_installment_refund` and `is_period_certain`, the
  death benefit into `is_rop`, the timing into `is_arrears`, the trigger into
  `is_trigger_either`, the market type into `is_qlac`, and the two bases into
  `is_generational` and `is_formula_basis`; and beside each column a `has_*` flag, whether
  the value is one `DIA_US_S` names. Each decodes as `DIA_US_S` compares the column,
  exactly, case and whitespace included, so a value no flag names sets no `has_*` flag, and
  the decode that reads it raises `DIA_US_S`'s message, `invalid income_form` and the like,
  where the projection first meets it, as at stage `E`. The `joint` flag is the column as
  `Data` checked it, `True` or `False`, read as 1 or 0.
- **Tables indexed by integers.** The mortality table and the improvement scale, keyed by
  age and sex, are each numbered by its own sexes, in sorted order, from 1, and held by
  schedule and attained age in `mort_table_array` and `improvement_array`, padded with
  NaN from age 0 so that the age is the index, with the first and last age of each
  schedule beside them. Each point carries the schedule of each life's sex in each table,
  read through `mort_schedule(life)` and `improvement_schedule(life)`, and each table's
  one reader, `mort_rate_base_at(x, life)` or `improvement_rate_at(x, life)`, checks the
  age against the schedule's extents before it reads, so nothing reads the padding, and
  refuses an age outside them naming the point, the age and the life, where
  `DIA_US_S`'s `.loc` raised `KeyError`. The two factor tables are not arrays by their
  keys. `DIA_US_S` reads the return-of-premium factor at the attained age and the
  deferral of every premium month it prices, and neither key is bounded by a contract, so
  an array sized by the keys would be sized by the file's largest; and both tables are four
  rows. So each is row vectors in the file's order, its sex numbered as the age tables
  number theirs and the payout form coded, and `payout_factor()` and `rop_factor(k)` scan
  the rows for the point's key, the table's count cell the scan's bound, the first match
  its only one, since the count cell refuses a key on two rows. A key no row holds is
  refused there, naming the point and the key.
- **The premium schedule, a table by policy month.** `DIA_US_S` filters the long table for
  the point's rows, sorts them and builds a dictionary of month to amount, once a point, in
  `premium_by_mth()`, and `premium_pm(k)` read it with `dict.get` at stage `E`. Here
  `Data`'s `premium_array()` holds each point's premiums by policy month, a row of the table
  a point, summed month by month as `premium_by_mth` sums them: the point's rows sorted by
  month as `DIA_US_S` sorts them, each amount added to the month's total from 0.0, so a
  month with two rows holds `DIA_US_S`'s float to the last bit. `premium_rows()` counts each
  month's rows, so that the pricing kernel's fixed point visits a month with a premium of
  0.0, as `DIA_US_S`'s dictionary holds it, and `premium_last()` is a point's last month
  with a row. The table is as wide as the schedule's latest month and one, 61 months as
  shipped, 25 KB for the committed points, and never wider than `Data.premium_last_mth` and
  one, 1,440 months, 23 KB a point: a premium after policy month 1,439 belongs to a point
  whose income starts later than the caches hold, which `stop_mth()` refuses before any
  premium is read, so no premium a projection reads is left out.
- **Codes.** A timing, a kind or a phase, which `DIA_US_S` spells as text, is an int
  Reference named as the text: the count's timings `BEF_NB = 0` and `BEF_DECR = 1`, the
  kinds `DEATH = 0` and `REFUND = 1`, with `ALL = 2` for `DIA_US_S`'s `None`, and the
  phases `PRE_ISSUE = 0`, `DEFERRAL = 1`, `PAYOUT = 2` and `TERMINATED = 3`. So are the
  three sets of arguments the pricing kernel passes its annuity factor (below),
  `PURCHASE = 0`, `ADJUST_OLD = 1` and `ADJUST_NEW = 2`. A call reads as before, less the
  quotes: `pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)`, `claims(t, DEATH)`, and `phase(t)` returns a code. A
  string argument would give the cell a dictionary for a cache, where a code indexes a C
  array, so each family is numbered from 0 without a gap, the timings by instant, as in
  every SEC model. A cell compares a code with `==` or `!=` alone, so that a text passed
  where a code is taken meets the cell's own refusal in modelx too: `invalid timing`,
  `invalid kind` or `invalid basis`. The `Projection` docstring's *Codes* lists the twelve.
- **Two kinds and their total.** `DIA_US_S`'s `claims(t, kind=None)` and
  `claims_ann(y, kind=None)` are one kind's claims or, with `None`, the total of the two.
  Here each takes its kind, the code `ALL` for the total. `DIA_US_S`'s monthly total is
  the `+` of its two kinds' cells, `claims(t, "DEATH") + claims(t, "REFUND")`, and
  `claims(t, ALL)` keeps it as written, not as a sum from `0.0`, which would turn
  `DIA_US_S`'s `-0.0` into `0.0`: at an A/E factor of −0.5, which makes every death a
  negative number, `DIA_US_S`'s `claims(t)` is `-0.0` in 3,728 of the twins' 12,240
  months, and `claims(t, ALL)` is the same float, sign included, in every month. The
  annual total is a loop over the year's months, as it has been since the model first ran
  in force, a plain running sum where `DIA_US_S`'s `claims_ann` is Python's `sum`, which
  compensates its rounding: so `claims_ann(y, kind)` differs from `DIA_US_S`'s by an ulp or
  two in some years, the total in 154 of the twins' policy years at the shipped
  assumptions, which the twin identity compares to its tolerance, 1e-9 relative. No
  number moved for it: compensating the sum would move the annual report from what the
  model computed before compiling. `claim_pp(t, kind)` takes `DEATH` or `REFUND` alone,
  and refuses `ALL`, `invalid kind`, as `DIA_US_S`'s `claim_pp(t, None)` raises. The twin
  identity compares `DIA_US_S`'s `claims(t, None)` and `claims_ann(y, None)` with the
  calls at `ALL` (*Tests*, below).
- **The pricing kernel, keyed by integers.** `DIA_US_S`'s `annuity_factor` takes a start
  month, a float guarantee period, a float rate and a valuation month, and
  `pricing_disc_factor` a float number of years, so each would compile with a dictionary
  for a cache, its body Python. Neither is called by a compiled cell. The discount is
  written out where `DIA_US_S` called it, `(1 + i_p)^(−yrs)`, the same power; the factor on
  each set of arguments `DIA_US_S` passes it with the final guarantee period is
  `annuity_factor_at(k, basis)`, keyed by the month it is valued at and the basis code, its
  body `annuity_factor`'s, the same operations in the same order; and
  `guarantee_mths_pricing()`, whose guarantee period changes at each step of its fixed
  point, runs a copy of the same body inline, with locals of its own. It totals the
  premiums as `DIA_US_S`'s `sum(premium_by_mth().values())` does, compensated as CPython's
  `sum` compensates, written out over the months of the premium table with a row. Each is
  `DIA_US_S`'s float to the last bit.
- **Rounding, on the integers or by admission.** `rop_factor(k)` reads its table at
  `DIA_US_S`'s `int(round(deferral_yrs(k)))`, the deferral rounded half to even, which is
  now `rop_deferral_yrs(k)`, an int cell that rounds the months on the integers, held equal
  to `round` at every key. `purchase_rate(k)` rounds the rate to the point's
  `purchase_rate_dp` places with `round(pr, dp)`, as `DIA_US_S` does, a rate built from
  `Projection`'s References: that one call is kept, and `tests/us_registry.py` admits it by
  cell, `"python_calls": {"purchase_rate": ("round",)}`. No other formula outside the
  reporting and engine cells calls a Python builtin outside its refusals but `int`, `float`,
  `bool`, `abs`, `min`, `max` and `range`, which Cython turns into C. `payment_freq()`
  compares the element with each of 12, 4, 2 and 1 rather than hold `int()` of it in a
  local, which would keep a Python object in the cell. No cell is uncached.
- **Reporting cells stay Python.** `model_point()`, the label accessors `market_type()`,
  `income_form()`, `payout_form()`, `db_form()`, `payment_timing()`, `mort_basis()`,
  `factor_basis()`, `reduction_trigger()` and `sex(life)`, and the three reports return a
  table row, text and DataFrames, for a reader, for `run_sec.py` and for the comparison
  with `DIA_US_S`. No other cell calls them, so they cost the projection nothing. Each
  label returns its point's column: the column of its own name, but `payment_timing` the
  `timing` column, `sex(life)` the `sex` or `joint_sex` column by life, and `payout_form`
  the `income_form` column with `LO_ROP` read as `LO`, which the registry entry declares in
  `"reporting_columns"`, so that the conventions hold each label to the column it returns.
  The first eight validate their column, as `DIA_US_S`'s do, so each returns text or
  raises, and compiles to a Python `str`. `sex(life)` returns its column as read, and
  `Data` accepts a single-life point's `joint_sex` that is not text, a blank, which the
  committed table holds and pandas reads as NaN, or a number, which no projection reads.
  So it compiles to a Python object, as the sample traces it (below), with one of the
  three dictionaries for a cache in `Projection`, and returns what modelx returns. The four
  checks are reporting cells too, but they return a verdict, which compiles to a C `bint`.
- **Engine cells stay Python too.** Five cells of `DIA_US_S`'s are kept for a reader and
  for the comparison with `DIA_US_S`, and no compiled cell calls them, the registry's
  `"engine"`: the two of float parameters above, which compile with C signatures and the
  other two of `Projection`'s three dictionary caches, and `premium_schedule()`,
  `premium_by_mth()` and `qlac_flags()`, which take no parameter and return a DataFrame, a
  dictionary and a list, which no C type holds. `DIA_US_S`'s tests assert the first two's
  returns, and the third's list is the QLAC overlay's verdict for a reader; the projection
  reads the premiums from `premium_array()` and `is_qlac()` from its flag.

The `Data` docstring lists its vectors, arrays and counts, each with the column or file it
comes from: 50 vectors of int64 by point and 13 of float64, the 12 `_ok` flags, the `joint`
flag, the 17 flags decoded from text, the six schedules and the last premium months among
the first;
the mortality table and the improvement scale, float64 by schedule and attained age, and
their first and last ages, int64 by schedule; the two factor tables, six vectors of int64
and two of float64 by row; the premium table, float64 by point and policy month, with its
row counts beside it, int64; and seven int counts and widths, each a table's check,
`mort_sexes`, `improvement_sexes` and `premium_width` among them. The seven readers stay
Python, returning DataFrames and a path, and no `Projection` cell but `model_point()` and
the engine cells reads them. Every other cell of `Projection`, 138 of its 154, returns a C
`bint`, `long long` or `double`, and all but the two engine cells of float parameters cache
a single value, or a C array the spec sizes from the contract:

| Compiled to | Cells |
|---|---|
| a C array of 1,563 by `t`, of `double`, `long long` or `bint` | the 43 cells of `t` alone: every count, premium, income, factor, instalment, claim, commutation and cash flow; the policy clock, its years and the calendar year; the flags `is_active`, `is_payout`, `is_payment_mth` and `accel_blackout`; the phase; and the checks' monthly residuals |
| a C array of 1,563 by 3 | the ten cells of `t` and a life or a code: `age`, `lives_if`, `lives_death`, `mort_rate_base`, `improvement_rate`, `mort_rate` and `mort_rate_mth`, by `(t, life)`; `pols_if_at`, by `(t, timing)`; and `claim_pp` and `claims`, by `(t, kind)` |
| a C array of 1,447 by `k` | the 15 cells of a policy month: the premium, the pricing survival's last-death curve, every pricing cell, `rop_deferral_yrs` among them, and the payout schedule, its floor and the instalments scheduled to date |
| a C array of 1,447 by 3 | `lives_if_pm`, by `(k, life)`, and `annuity_factor_at`, by `(k, basis)` |
| a C array of 123 by `y`, or of 123 by 3 | `lives_if_ann` and `annuity_payments_ann`, by policy year; `mort_rate_py` and `mort_rate_mth_py`, by `(y, life)`; and `claims_ann`, by `(y, kind)` |
| a C array of 121 by 3 | `mort_rate_base_at` and `improvement_rate_at`, by `(x, life)` |
| a C array of 3 | `age_at_entry`, `lives_if_init`, `mort_schedule` and `improvement_schedule`, by `life` |
| one `long long`, `double` or `bint` | the 55 cells without a parameter: the point's label, numbers, decodes and flags, its opening state, its pricing factors, guarantee periods and payout income, the ends of its frame, and the four checks |
| a C `double` with a dictionary for a cache | the engine cells `annuity_factor` and `pricing_disc_factor` |
| a Python object | the nine reporting cells and the three engine cells above that return a container, and the three reports |

The declarations the build generates, `_mx_classes.pxd` in the compiled package, are the
record of it, and the three dictionaries among `Projection`'s caches there are `sex`'s,
`annuity_factor`'s and `pricing_disc_factor`'s.

### The sample and the spec

mx2cy types each cell from the values the sample run passes it and gets back, and a cell
the run never calls compiles as a Python object. So `sample_sec.py` runs the three reports
and the four checks on every committed point, which reach every cell but these:
`model_point()` and the label accessors, which only a reader asks for; `point_id()`, which
only a refusal names; the cells `DIA_US_S` keeps for a reader, `guarantee_yrs()`,
`accel_cost()`, `payout_factor_calc()`, `is_qlac()`, `other_qlac_premium()` and the three
engine cells that return a container; the two engine cells of float parameters, called at
the arguments `DIA_US_S`'s payout factor passes; and, over the frame and the month after
it, `phase`, `accel_payment_factor`, `cola_factor`, `calendar_year` and `qlac_room`, and for
each covered life the attained age, the base-table rate, the improvement rate and the
deaths, which the rates by policy year replace in every flow. The sample calls those too.
Every timing of `pols_if_at`, both kinds of `claim_pp` and all three of `claims` are reached
by the reports, the start-date adjustment's two bases of `annuity_factor_at` by the
adjusting point and its purchase basis by every point on the formula basis. A call a cell
refuses is not made, since a raise is not traced: a single life's second age reads a blank
`joint_age`, and `claim_pp` refuses the total. It projects the committed points alone: the
export it runs reads the CSVs of the directory the build is made in, and the trace it needs
is the committed points', which are what the tests project. It calls `sex(1)` and `sex(2)`
once more, on a copy of the table's first point, a single life, with its `joint_sex` blank,
which it writes to a temporary directory and reads by a second instance of the export,
given the file's absolute path as `model_point_file`. That types `sex` as a Python object,
so that a blank or numeric sex returns what modelx returns rather than raising `TypeError`
(*What compiling changed, and why*); the other eight labels validate their column, and the
run calls them on the committed points alone. The committed points leave branches
untaken: payments other than monthly, the `LO_ROP` form, a part commutation, the table
basis on a male life, the generational basis on a joint life, an installment refund in
advance whose income starts at the age stop. That still types every cell, because every
branch of a cell returns the one type its others return, a rate a float in every branch,
`0.0` or `False` outside the frame, and on points that take those branches the compiled
model computes modelx's numbers (*Tests*, below). The sample also raises the recursion
limit, which modelx raises and its export does not (*What a compiled run needs*, below).

`spec_sec.py` sizes each C-array cache, by the names of the cells' parameters, and a
compiled cache raises `IndexError` for an argument outside it. So each size covers the
largest argument a cell is called with on a point the contract allows, in its frame and
in the month after it, `t = proj_len()`, which `lives_if` reads and the compile tests' full
sweep evaluates every monthly cell at; plus one because the index starts at 0, and one of
headroom:

| Parameters | Size | The largest argument |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | 1,563 | 1,561. The longest frame runs from a contract issued 120 months on, the furthest ahead `Data.future_horizon_mth` admits as shipped, to its stop rule, which on a covered life of issue age 0, the youngest `issue_age_min` admits, is at policy month 12 × (120 − 0) + 1 = 1,441: an installment refund in advance whose income starts at the age stop rounds its refund period up to a whole instalment, one month past it. So 1,561 months, `t = 0 … 1,560`, and the month after, 1,561. Nothing reads `t + 1` at `t = proj_len()` |
| `t`, and `life`, `timing` or `kind` | 1,563 by 3 | the lives 1 and 2, the timings `BEF_NB` 0 and `BEF_DECR` 1, and the kinds `DEATH` 0, `REFUND` 1 and `ALL` 2. Every 2-D cache has this one width, the widest. Cython's generated unpickle code converts a space's caches of one depth with one function for each inner shape, and given two widths it passes the narrower where the wider is expected, which gcc 14 refuses and which would write past its end (`WholeLife_US_SEC`'s *The sample and the spec*); MSVC accepts it. A timing 2 or a life 0 is then inside the cache, where the cell refuses it as modelx does, and a code or a life of 3 raises `IndexError`, compiled alone |
| `k`, and `life` or `basis` | 1,447, and 1,447 by 3 | 1,445. The payout schedule, its floor and the instalments scheduled to date are read to the stop rule's month less one, 1,440, and to `horizon_mths()`, 1,440; the premiums, their pricing and the start-date adjustment's factors at policy months up to the income start month, 1,440 at most; and the schedule, its floor and the pricing survival five months past an acceleration exercised at the age stop, 1,440 at most, 1,445, as `accel_cost()` reads them: 12 × (`omega_age` − `issue_age_min`) + `accel_months` − 1. `Data` bounds the exercise month from below alone; past the age stop `accel_cost()` reads the survival a month after the stop alone, 1,441 at most, which is `DIA_US_S`'s at every later month when `mort_ae_factor` is 1 or more. Beside it the lives and the three bases, 3 wide |
| `y`, and `life` or `kind` | 123, and 123 by 3 | 121, the policy year of policy month 1,440, read by the projection's mortality, and of 1,445, read by the pricing survival; the annual display cells to the stop rule's year, 120 |
| `x` and `life` | 121 by 3 | 119, the last attained age below `omega_age`, read by the two age readers from the youngest issue age, 0 |
| `life` | 3 | 2, in `age_at_entry`, `lives_if_init` and the two schedules |

`stop_mth()` refuses, naming the point, before it asks the stop rule, what the caches
cannot hold, in this order: a covered life whose issue age is below `issue_age_min`, 0,
on every form, the primary's and, on a joint contract, the joint annuitant's each asked;
an income start month past `12 * (omega_age - issue_age_min)`, 1,440, the one elected at
issue and the one a start-date adjustment moves it to each asked, since the premiums
before an adjustment are priced to the old month; and a certain period ending past that
month. It asks first because the installment refund's period, which the stop rule reads,
searches the payout schedule up to `horizon_mths()`, and it asks in `stop_mth()` rather
than in `proj_len()` so that every cell of a refused point that reads the frame, through
`is_active(t)`, refuses it as `proj_len()` does, in both engines. `Data` already refuses a
negative issue age, so the first refuses nothing as shipped. The other two are recorded
departures, refusals of what the caches cannot hold, as `SPIA_US_SEC` refuses a certain
period of more than 1,440 months: `DIA_US_S` projects an income start month, or a certain
period's end, past 1,440.
`DIA_US_S` projects every form at any issue age, its frame running to the age stop on its
youngest life, so the caches are sized for issue age 0 on every form, below the 22
`product-spec.md` issues at: refusing a point below 22 would refuse a point `DIA_US_S`
projects, which stage `E` projected (D2). The product-spec's income start months, 13 to
360, and certain periods, 10 to 30 years, bound nothing either. `issue_age_min`,
`omega_age`, `accel_months` and `Data.future_horizon_mth` are the contract the sizes are
derived from. Raise `omega_age`, `accel_months` or the horizon, and a report runs past the
caches in the compiled model alone: a frame of more than 1,562
months, a policy month past 1,446, a policy year past 122 or an age past 120 raises
`IndexError`, naming nothing, where modelx projects. Each needs the sizes derived again,
as `spec_sec.py` derives them, and a rebuild: `t` raised to 12 × (`omega_age` −
`issue_age_min`) + the horizon + 3, `k` to 12 × (`omega_age` − `issue_age_min`) +
`accel_months` + 1, `y` to `omega_age` − `issue_age_min` + 3, and `x` to `omega_age` + 1;
and `Data.premium_last_mth`, 12 × (`omega_age` − `issue_age_min`) − 1, with them, which a
test holds to the spec. The shipped age tables start at age 20, so a point at a younger
issue age is refused today by its first rate, naming it; the ages from 0 are the
contract's, which extended tables reach.

### Two compiler directives

`tools/build_sec_cy.py` marks the module mx2cy translates `# cython: infer_types=True,
cpow=True`, and compiles it with `-ffp-contract=off` on every platform but Windows, as
`Term_US_SEC`'s *Two compiler directives* sets out, with what each costs and what it was
measured to change there. Here `cpow` reaches the powers of every compiled cell: the
monthly mortality rates, `1 − (1 − q)^(1/12)` in `mort_rate_mth` and `mort_rate_mth_py`;
the generational improvement, `(1 − G2_x)^k` in `mort_rate_py`; every discount of the
pricing kernel, `v^((s − k)/12)` in `annuity_factor_at` and in `guarantee_mths_pricing`'s
inline copy, `(1 + i_p)^(−d)` in `annuity_factor_def`, `rop_factor_calc` and
`accel_cost`; the COLA, `(1 + c)^(d // 12)` in `cola_factor_pm`; the commutation discount,
`(1 + i_c)^(−(k − m)/12)` in `commuted_value` and its check's residual; and expense
inflation, `(1 + π)^(t // 12)` in `inflation_factor`. Without `cpow` a compiler with C99's
complex numbers, gcc among them, computes a power of two doubles as a complex power, which
can differ from Python's float power in its last bits. With both directives and the flag
every compiled value agrees with modelx's bit for bit, and the compile tests hold each, by
the module's first line, by the compiler's command lines and, on x86-64, by the comparison
itself. On Windows MSVC compiles without the flag, since it emits no fused multiply-add for
x64 without `/arch:AVX2`, which setuptools does not pass, and the comparison is exact there
too. On the same platforms as the flag the tool adds `-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types`,
so that gcc before 14, which only warns of a pointer of the wrong type, fails the build as
gcc 14 does: the error two cache widths give (*The sample and the spec*, above). MSVC
accepts two widths without a word, so on Windows the one width rests on a test that holds
every 2-D size in `spec_sec.py` to the one width (*Tests*, below).

### What a compiled run needs

**Memory, and the release.** A compiled `Projection` ItemSpace is a C struct of 1,729,808
bytes, about 1.7 MB, the type's basic size, which holds every cell's cache, each beside a
flag array of its shape that marks what is computed. Its 53 caches of 1,563 months, 43 by
`t` alone and ten 3 wide, are most of it. That is 1.5 times `SPIA_US_SEC`'s, for frames
of 1,563 months and the pricing kernel's caches by policy month besides. Making one costs
time as well as memory: Python zeroes the struct when it makes the ItemSpace, and making
and releasing one, nothing computed, the runner's collection included, took 0.36 ms here,
of the 0.87 ms a compiled point takes (*Speed*, below). Deleting it,
`del model.Projection[idx]`, frees nothing by itself: an ItemSpace sits in reference
cycles, and only Python's cyclic collector frees it. That is why `run_sec.py --block`
collects after each release, in its frame pass and in its projections (*Run it*, above),
and a compile test holds a compiled block run to one point's ItemSpace at a time. Without
it, 494 compiled points peaked at 785 MB (*Speed*, below).

**Stack, not recursion limit.** A compiled chain of cells calls C to C, on the C stack,
which the interpreter's recursion limit does not count, so the compiled model needs no limit
raised. What it needs is stack. The deepest call the contract allows, a cold `net_cf` in the
last month of the longest cover, 1,440 months from issue age 0, runs a chain of one cell a
month back to `t_entry()`: 1,451 cells deep in modelx on a cash refund and on a joint
contract issued at 0 and 0, at the valuation date and issued 120 months on, and on a period
certain and the advance-timing twin at the valuation date; 1,446 on an installment refund;
and 1,447 on one in advance whose income starts at the age stop, its frame 1,561 months
(*Counts and timings*, above). Compiled with MSVC 14.37, on this machine, each runs on a
thread of 384 KiB of stack and dies on one of 320. Windows rounds a thread's reservation up
to 64 KiB, so the bytes a level were read from the longest chain that runs at fixed
reservations, a cold `net_cf(t)` on the cash refund issued at 0, found to five months: 404
months at 128 KiB, 696 at 192, 989 at 256 and 1,281 at 320, 292 months more for each 64 KiB,
224 bytes a level, and 36 KiB besides, so about 354 KiB at 1,451 levels. These are MSVC's
figures. A test runs the call in a thread of 1 MiB, the stack Windows gives a program's main
thread unless the program is linked for more, and again on the main thread, which is where
`run_sec.py --cython` runs, and which reserved 2,031,616 bytes here: 2.9 and 5.6 times the
need. gcc's frames are another compiler's, and its figures come from the `cython` CI job's
Linux leg, which runs the test there: the test first runs the call at nine stacks, from 256
KiB to 2 MiB, and its warning reports the smallest it ran on. On `SPIA_US_SEC`'s chain, as
long as this one, that leg ran the call on 768 KiB and not on 640, about 440 to 540 bytes a
level, more than twice the 234 MSVC took there on this machine, and the Windows leg's MSVC
ran it on 448 KiB and not on 384. At that ratio this chain would need about 610 to 770 KiB
on gcc, 1.3 to 1.7 times under 1 MiB: an estimate, until the Linux leg records this one. A
stack below the need kills its child on an overflow, by design; on Windows the child ends
with `STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW`, and should Windows Error Reporting hold it instead, the test
waits a bounded time for each child rather than the job's hour. The export recurses in
Python instead: the same call needs a recursion limit of 2,924 there on the cash refund, the
joint contract and the advance-timing twin, 2,899 on the installment refund and 2,901 on the
one in advance, and the three reports and the four checks, which run in ascending `t`, need
48 on the committed points from a script's top level, and 64 where the installment refund's
twin is the first point read, `Data`'s first reads among its frames. So `sample_sec.py` sets
12,000, four times the first rounded up to the thousand, and a test holds it to that
derivation.

### What it refuses

The compiled model refuses what modelx refuses, with the same message. modelx raises its
`FormulaError`, which quotes the error; compiled, the error itself propagates.

- What `Data` cannot read for the whole table, when the array is first read, naming the
  table and its points or lines: what `model_point_table()` and `premium_schedule_table()`
  refuse, as at stage `E` (*The in-force interface* and *The premium schedule*, above), a
  `point_id` or a `premium_mth` of `2**53` or more in the premium schedule among them,
  `premium_schedule_sec.csv: premium_mth must be below 2**53 months, which an int64 holds
  exactly; it is not at point_id [18]`; a label of the model point table that is not a
  whole number below `2**53` in size, from `Data.point_id`, when a label is first read;
  and what the four count cells refuse in the assumption tables (*Departures from
  DIA_US_S*, above), with, now that a key is an int64, a key of `2**53` or more in size,
  `mort_table.csv: age must be below 2**53 in size, which an int64 holds exactly; it is not
  on line [2]`, and, now that the age tables are held from age 0, a negative age,
  `mort_table.csv: age must be 0 or more, the table being held from age 0; it is not on
  line [2]`.
- What a point's projection cannot use, by the cell that reads it, naming the point, and no
  other point for it: an int column that `int()` cannot read, or of `2**53` or more in
  size, which an int64 cannot be trusted to hold, `point_id 4: accel_mth must be blank or
  below 2**53 months in size; it is not`. Stage `E`'s checks refuse at first read every
  value that is not a whole number, out of its range, blank where read or text, as they
  did (*The in-force interface*, above), so what reaches the accessors is the size alone,
  and a single-life point's blank `joint_age`, which no projection reads, and which a
  direct call of `age_at_entry(2)` refuses. A month of `2**53 − 1` that the projection never
  reaches, an acceleration past the stop rule, projects, and `accel_cost()` is `DIA_US_S`'s
  0 there: from the limiting age on the rate is 1, so `DIA_US_S`'s survival in every month
  after the age stop is the one it reaches a month after it, which is the month read.
- A value of `income_form`, `db_form`, `timing`, `reduction_trigger`, `market_type`,
  `mort_basis` or `factor_basis` none of `DIA_US_S`'s values names, compared exactly, case
  and whitespace included, by the decode that reads it, with `DIA_US_S`'s message,
  `invalid income_form`, as at stage `E`; and a frequency other than 12, 4, 2 or 1,
  `invalid frequency`.
- A key a table lacks, by its reader, naming the point and the key, where `DIA_US_S`'s
  `.loc` raised `KeyError`: an attained age, `point_id 6: mort_table.csv has no mort_rate
  at attained age 10 for the sex of life 1`, on a point issued at 10 on the shipped tables,
  which start at 20, and the same for the improvement scale; and a payout or
  return-of-premium factor, `point_id 5: payout_factor_table.csv has no payout_factor at
  income_start_age 81 for the point's sex and payout form`, on the anchor cell issued at 61
  on the table basis, where the report that reads the factor raises and a cell that does
  not, `net_cf(0)` before the income start month, still computes. On the table basis a
  premium of 0.0 whose ROP key the table lacks is refused by `guarantee_mths_pricing()`
  alone, which `guarantee_yrs()` and `run_sec.py`'s pricing line show: the premiums are
  priced on the table's payout factor, so the cash flows project, as `DIA_US_S`'s do.
- By `stop_mth()`, before the stop rule, and so by `proj_len()` and every cell of the
  point that reads the frame: a covered life issued below `issue_age_min`, `point_id 1:
  issue age 60 is below issue_age_min, 61` with the Reference raised to 61; an income
  start month past 1,440, `point_id 1: income_start_mth 1441 is past 12 * (omega_age -
  issue_age_min), 1440, the latest policy month the caches are sized for`, and the same for
  the month an adjustment moves it to, `adjust_start_mth 1441`; and a certain period ending
  past it, `point_id 3: the certain period of 30 years from policy month 1100 ends past 12 *
  (omega_age - issue_age_min), 1440, the latest policy month the caches are sized for`;
  then, by `proj_len()`, as at stage `E`, a point at or past the stop rule, a contract
  owing nothing and an acceleration inside a commuted guarantee.
- A timing, a kind, a basis or a life a cell does not take, `ValueError("invalid timing")`,
  `ValueError("invalid kind")`, `ValueError("invalid basis")` and
  `ValueError("invalid life")`, where it is inside the cell's cache: `pols_if_at(0, 2)`,
  `claim_pp(0, ALL)`, and a life of 0, `lives_if_init(0)` or `age_at_entry(0)`.

An argument outside a cache raises `IndexError` in the compiled model alone, as above:
`net_cf(1563)` and `net_cf(-1)`, which modelx answers with 0, the month being outside
cover; `pols_if_at(0, 3)`, `claim_pp(0, 3)`, `claims(0, 3)`, `claims_ann(1, 3)` and
`annuity_factor_at(0, 3)`, which modelx refuses as an invalid code; `lives_if_init(3)`,
which modelx refuses as `invalid life`; `premium_pm(1447)`, `cum_annuity_pp(1447)` and
`mort_rate_py(123, 1)`, which modelx computes, and `premium_pm(-1)` and
`cum_annuity_pp(-1)`, which modelx reads as the premium of the table's last month, 50,000
on point 1, and as 0; and
`mort_rate_base_at(121, 1)`, which modelx refuses, naming the age. No projection makes
those calls. One report cell reaches past a cache under a Reference moved from its shipped
value: with `mort_ae_factor` below 1 the rate past the limiting age is the A/E, so
`DIA_US_S`'s survival there is positive and `accel_cost()` reads it at the exercise and
five months on, as `DIA_US_S` does; an exercise at policy month 1,442 or later then raises
`IndexError` compiled alone, where modelx gives `DIA_US_S`'s cost. A direct call of a cell
that does not read the frame, on a point `stop_mth()` refuses, can reach past a cache the
same way, where modelx computes; a projection asks the frame first.
An `idx` past the last row is refused in both, with an `IndexError` at the
first read of a vector, and `Projection[-1]` reads every vector at its last element in
both, so it is the table's last point, under that point's own `point_id()`.

A Reference is a C variable of its value's type: `issue_age_min`, `omega_age`,
`mort_table_year`, `pricing_iters`, `accel_months`, `qlac_max_start_age`, the codes and
`idx` a `long long`, as
`Data.future_horizon_mth` and `Data.premium_last_mth` are, and the rates and amounts a
`double`. Set past that type, it is converted when it is set, where modelx keeps the value
as given. A float set on an int Reference is truncated toward zero without a word,
`pricing_iters = 3.7` reading 3. A text, a NaN or an int beyond 64 bits is refused at once,
with `TypeError`, `ValueError` or `OverflowError`: `ALL = "x"` and `pricing_rate = "x"` are
`TypeError`s, `omega_age = float("nan")` a `ValueError`. An int set on a `double` Reference
reads as a float compiled, `expense_maint = 50` reading 50.0. Each shipped Reference is a
value of its C type, so no shipped number differs. And a Reference set past its domain
computes as C computes, where modelx raises: an `inflation_rate` of `1e300` makes
`inflation_factor(24)` infinite compiled, where modelx's power raises `OverflowError`.

An annual mortality above 1 is not refused but capped, in both: `mort_rate_py` caps the
rate, improved and times the A/E factor, at 1, `min(mort_ae_factor * q, 1.0)`, as
`DIA_US_S` caps it. Uncapped, the
monthly rate, `1 − (1 − q)^(1/12)`, would be complex in modelx and NaN compiled, silently.
Capped, both compute 1. A NaN rate stays NaN through the cap, in both, the rate written
first: a NaN `mort_ae_factor`, set as a Reference, makes the first month's rate NaN in
both, and the checks fail on the NaN residuals it leaves, the survival check on every twin
(*Tests*, below).

### Speed

`python tools/bench_sec_cy.py deferred_income_annuity` builds the model into a temporary
directory, or takes a build with `--build`, and times one block run on three engines:
modelx, the export and the compiled model. Each engine runs the committed table repeated,
in a process of its own, as `run_sec.py --block` runs a block, each point projected and
then released. Each copy's premium schedule is repeated with it, each row under its point's
label in the copy, so that every point reads its own premiums. `net_cf` is `net_cf(t)`
summed over the frame, the projection alone, as `basiclife/BasicTerm_SC` is timed on its
`pv_net_cf()`; `result_cf` is the report `run_sec.py` prints, which builds a DataFrame for
each point. Each time is the fastest of three runs, with their spread in seconds:

| Engine | Points | `net_cf`, a point | `result_cf`, a point | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| compiled | 6,006 | 0.860 ms (5.16–6.27) | 1.29 ms (7.77–8.43) | 92 MB |
| export | 624 | 8.49 ms (5.30–6.06) | 8.81 ms (5.50–6.57) | 81 MB |
| modelx | 130 | 199 ms (25.84–28.86) | 207 ms (26.88–32.40) | 141 MB |

The benchmark was run twice, straight after each other on the same build, three runs of
each engine and loop each time; the table gives the fastest of the six, and the spread of
all six. On `net_cf` the compiled model runs 9.9 times its export, and on `result_cf`, where
building the DataFrame takes much of its time, 6.8 times; it runs 231 and 160 times
modelx. The first run alone gave the compiled model 0.868 and 1.32 ms, the export 8.61 and
8.96 ms and modelx 202 and 223 ms, 9.9 and 6.8 times the export again. The compiled model
runs about as many times its export as `Term_US_SEC`, 9.5, and `SPIA_US_SEC`, 9.5 to 9.9:
of its 0.86 ms, making and releasing the ItemSpace, which Python zeroes, takes about
0.36 ms. As it stood after running in force, compiled the same way, the model ran 1.9
times its export (*What compiling changed, and why*, above, measured on a build not
shipped, so not reproducible from the repository), and the compiled model runs 9.6 times
that build on the same measure, 0.784 ms a point over the committed points against 7.51:
the representation, not the compiler, is the gain, and the export gained from it too,
8.19 ms a point against 14.0. The release keeps a block flat: the compiled model's peak
grew by under 2 MB over its 6,006 points, and without the collection after each release
(`--no-collect`), 494 compiled points peaked at 785 MB. Reading the six files and building
every `Data` vector and array for those points took 0.49 s, and asking every point for its
frame, the runner's first pass, 2.3 s, most of it making and releasing an ItemSpace a
point. Every engine, loop and run summed `net_cf` over a copy of the table to
−7,605,349.454.

Measured on 2026-11-14 on a desktop shared with other work: 12 cores and 20 threads (an
Intel Core i7-12700KF), 64 GB, Windows 11; Python 3.13.18, its extensions compiled by MSVC
14.37 (Visual Studio 2022), with modelx 0.33.0, modelx-cython 0.1.0, Cython 3.3.1, numpy
2.5.4 and pandas 3.1.1. Windows reports no load average: sampled every 10 seconds, the
processors were 6 to 15% busy during the first run, mostly 7 to 10%, and 5 to 12% during
the second, of which the benchmark's own process, one thread, is 5 points; other runs of
this page's, a modelx probe or a compiled one at a time, and another session's tests ran
beside both. Each time is the fastest of its runs; the fastest run is the one to compare.
The comparisons over the committed points, with the build as it stood after running in
force, are the fastest of three runs each, in a process an engine and run, and so is the
cost of an ItemSpace, the fastest of five rounds of 1,000.

## Tests

- **The twin identity**, in `tests/test_model_conventions.py`: on points 1 to 17, issued at
  the valuation date, every cell of `DIA_US_S`'s agrees at every argument `DIA_US_S`
  evaluates in its own sweep, but for `pols_if_init`, `model_point` and `result_pols`, whose
  meaning changed, and a cell this model lacked would fail it; `DIA_US_S`'s `claims(t,
  None)` and `claims_ann(y, None)` are compared with the calls at `ALL`, through the spec's
  `twin_arg_map`, and its timing, kind and phase strings with the codes. So the goldens
  `tests/test_deferred_income_annuity_us.py` asserts on those points — the projection table
  of the worked example, the two slice purchase rates and the income they buy, the derived
  guarantee period, the death-benefit fork, the certain floor's conditioning on reaching the
  income phase, the joint return-of-premium pricing, the three options, the QLAC overlay and
  the generational construction — hold here with no number restated. The identity holds on
  any count, since neither model charges acquisition. The same suite holds the model to the
  conventions every `_SEC` model meets: every frame starts at `t = 0`, new business joins
  the `BEF_NB` count and enters once at its `policy_count`, nothing happens before issue,
  and the in-force columns are present; and to `DIA_US_S`'s product fact, that the income
  actually starts, read on the policy clock: the income in force at the income start month,
  or at the valuation date on a contract past it, is positive, and is the payout schedule's.
  The convention that `pols_if` is the `BEF_DECR` count is skipped, because `pols_if` is
  that count weighted by survival (*Counts and timings*).
- **The splice**, in `tests/test_deferred_income_annuity_us_sec.py`: each `DIA_US_S` point
  restated in force at months either side of its events continues the S projection, in
  `result_cf`, in `result_pols`, column by column, and in every other cell the two share, to
  1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, which would hide the survival near the limiting age,
  the roll-forward residuals apart, which are rounding around 0 and keep a floor of 1e-9. It
  skips the cells the twin identity skips, and those whose value is a frame length, a time
  point on the valuation clock or a part of a file: `proj_len`, `payment_surv_mth`, the
  premium schedule's two readers, which hold only the premiums still due, and
  `result_annual`, whose first row holds part of a policy year; and on a row valued after
  its acceleration, `accel_payment_factor`, which nothing reads from the valuation date on.
  The months are those S's events need: around point 14's second premium, the income start
  month and the months either side of it, each option month and the months either side of
  it, the anniversaries, the last month of each refund period, derived period and guarantee
  and the first after it, inside a guarantee after the last death, the month before a cap on
  mortality binds, and a frame's last month. So do eighteen variants of S's points, each
  with its premium rows, in copies of S's table and schedule that are never committed, for
  branches S's own points do not reach: every category of every text column `DIA_US_S`
  branches or joins on, each frequency on both timings valued off its payment period, a
  guarantee that outlasts the age stop, both lives dead inside a guarantee, a commutation
  inside a derived period, an acceleration that straddles the end of a guarantee, valued in
  its deferral too, where the lump sum's floor reads a derived `l_last(T)`, an acceleration
  in a commuted guarantee's last month, and a QLAC failing each of its conditions.
  Inflation, the one input on the valuation clock, is set to 0 in both models. The
  reference rate's change, which ships at 0, is switched on in `DIA_US_S`, where it is each
  point's change since its own issue; this model reads the splice's table once, as a block
  is read, on one path of the reference rate: a point restated in force has seen
  `DIA_US_S`'s change by the valuation date, and carries it as `ref_rate_shift_init`, so
  this model's `ref_rate_shift` is 0, and a point issued later has seen none, so it is
  compared with `DIA_US_S` read again with its `ref_rate_shift` at 0, the same contract on
  that path. The A/E factor, which ships at a neutral 1.0, and the Baa yield, which ships so
  that the repricing rate equals the pricing rate, are set apart in both models, and so, in
  both copies, are the mortality table and the improvement scale, by age and sex: the
  shipped rates are band-constant over ages 60 to 84 and the male rates are the female
  rates three years on, where a join on the wrong age or sex would read the same number.
  Improvement itself is not neutralized: it is dated by the calendar on the policy clock.
- **The core grid and the full one.** By default the splice and the future business run a
  core of their cases, which between them reach every branch the full grid reaches, every
  opening-state column, every kind of valuation month and every frequency and timing, and a
  test asserts that they do. The other cases carry the `sec_full` marker and show as
  skipped, with the reason, unless `USLIB_SEC_FULL=1` is set. One leg of the CI matrix sets
  it, so every CI run runs the full grid too.
- **Future new business**: issued 13 months after the valuation date, more than a year on
  and off every payment step, eighteen of S's points and variants are each the S projection
  moved on, with its whole premium schedule, zeros before issue in `result_cf` and
  `result_pols`, the contracts arriving as new business with their first premium, no
  decrement rate evaluated before issue and neither table read below an issue age; and so
  are the anchor cell issued a month on, the joint point issued 12 months on, on the
  valuation date's anniversaries, and the commuting point issued 120 months on, at the
  horizon.
- **How it computes**: on every row the splice and the future business compare, after every
  report, no cell has been called at a negative argument, none evaluated from `t_entry()` on
  has read a month before it, and none evaluated at month `t` has read a month later than
  `t + 1`, directly or through a cell keyed by no month, such as `surv_to_payout()`, with no
  exception: the commutation residual reads back from the guarantee's end.
  Every policy-month, policy-year and age argument is one the contract has. On a fresh read
  of the committed model, `duration_mth(500)` evaluates `duration_mth` once, because the
  policy clock is a closed form, and every point is swept under modelx's recursion limit
  lowered to 40, which a recursion backward over the frame would exceed. A cold `net_cf` in
  the last month runs no deeper than one cell a month back to `t_entry()`, plus a fixed
  overhead, on the twins of the anchor, the installment refund and the joint point, on the
  cash refund a month into its income phase, on the joint point issued 13 months on, and at
  the longest cover the model projects, 1,440 months from issue age 0, on age tables
  extended to 0; and a cold `net_cf(0)` runs a few cells deep, where
  `DIA_US_S`'s recurses through survival to the income start month.
- **Counts, validation and regeneration**: the count is on the books from issue to the stop
  rule, and `pols_if_at` refuses a timing it does not have; `pols_if` is that count weighted
  by survival; `result_pols()` is `DIA_US_S`'s, column for column, with `pols_new_biz`
  beside it; multiplying `policy_count` by 2.5, a count that is not whole, with the
  reference rate's change switched on, multiplies every cash flow and the counts at each
  timing, and moves no per-contract value. Each malformed row is refused naming its point,
  each on a model read for it and again through a projection, and each by the one rule under
  test: among them a count, a duration, a month, a probability, an amount, a guarantee
  period, a frozen weight or a change that is not a number, an integer column that is not
  whole, the adjustment's months apart or out of order, an option before the income start
  month, a second life on a single-life contract, a state other than issue's on a contract
  not yet in force, a frozen weight or guarantee period missing where it is read, given
  where it is not, out of order, or a weight of 0, an adjustment at or after the income
  start month, an acceleration within six months of a commutation, and a `joint` flag or a
  sex that is not one of its values. Each malformed premium schedule is refused the same
  way, naming its point, and each malformed assumption table by the count cell beside its
  reader, naming the file's lines: a key blank, text or not whole, a sex or payout form no
  join reads, a key on two rows and a gap in a sex's ages, and a value blank, text,
  infinite or out of range, where a negative improvement rate projects as `DIA_US_S`
  projects it. Each kind of contract owing nothing, a point at or past the stop rule, and
  an acceleration inside a commuted guarantee are refused by `proj_len()` with their
  messages, and `run_sec.py --block` refuses such a table before printing anything; the
  horizon is a Reference, which at 0 refuses any future business, saying so; an unknown
  form, trigger, timing, basis, frequency or market type is refused where the model first
  reads it, the market type by the QLAC overlay alone, and so are a third life, a claim kind
  and a timing neither model knows; a zero count, integer columns written as floats, a
  contract issued 120 months on, an option month written −1, a fall in the reference rate
  since issue, a premium due between the elected income start month and a later adjusted
  one, a contract inside its guarantee with every life dead, and the assumption tables'
  keys written as floats are accepted; and the committed table and premium schedule are what
  `DIA_US_S` generates, and each derived and future row in them, projected at the shipped
  assumptions, is its `DIA_US_S` point from its month on, frame by frame and cell by cell,
  to 1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, the future row's premiums by month and annual
  display included, and only what the shipped expense inflation moves left out.
- **The opening state and the rest**: the derived rows carry the worked example over at the
  valuation date, with the figures above; pricing stays at issue and premium dates, the
  pricing survival `DIA_US_S`'s at every key and a slice still due priced at `DIA_US_S`'s
  rate; the payout schedule is `DIA_US_S`'s, bit for bit, and a fresh read of a cash refund
  in payout reads the instalments to date from the valuation date's key on alone, an
  installment refund from its income start month to the end of its derived period; each
  life's survival opens at its column; a contract open in its guarantee pays above the
  lives alive, and a commutation before the valuation date leaves its weight, a copy whose
  weight is the whole cohort paying nothing until the tail; the commutation residual closes
  at the guarantee's last month, where it is `DIA_US_S`'s at the exercise, an acceleration
  in that month included; an acceleration needs no column; three contracts in one table, in
  force, issued at the valuation date and issued later, read each the reference rate's
  change since its own issue, at `ref_rate_shift` 0 and 0.005, the last unmoved by it, and
  the floor applies to the whole change, the column and the Reference of opposite signs;
  improvement is dated by the calendar on the policy clock; where the cap on mortality
  binds, `DIA_US_S`'s own product passes 1, both models' annual and monthly rates are the
  float 1.0, every life alive at the start of the month dies in it, every report is float64
  and finite and every cell agrees with S, and a lost rate stays NaN; a check fails a
  residual that is not a number: with the A/E factor NaN, the survival check fails on every
  twin, and all four checks on the commuting point's twin, each on a residual NaN in some
  month and 0.0 in every other; expense inflation runs on the valuation clock at the
  shipped 2.5%, which only this test sees, since the splice sets the rate to 0; a contract
  issued later brings its premiums and no acquisition cost; the model has `pols_new_biz`
  and no lapse; the stop rule ends every frame; every guarded cell holds its value outside
  the frame and reads no rate there, `phase` reading `PRE_ISSUE` before issue and
  `TERMINATED` after the stop rule; the points of a block sum row by row; `result_annual`
  keeps the policy-year key; an extract without the generator's three columns, relabelled
  with its premium schedule and reversed, projects the same numbers; `run_sec.py` prints
  the model's numbers, for a point issued at the valuation date, points in payout, a
  one-row frame, a point issued later and the block; the docstrings describe the valuation
  clock and map every cell running in force adds; and the model reads `DIA_US_S`'s
  assumption tables in place.
- **The fingerprint** (C2): before the compile step changed anything, what the model
  computed on each committed point was frozen in the module, each column of `result_cf()`
  and `result_pols()`, its sum, its largest value and its values at five months, and the
  model reproduces it to 1e-12. `python tools/gen_sec_fingerprint.py DIA_US_SEC --check`
  makes the same comparison. The tests above held through the compile step with their call
  syntax changed: a point's position for its label, the codes for the text of a timing, a
  kind or a phase, and `ALL` for `DIA_US_S`'s `None`. Each point is named by its label, in
  `point_id()`, in a refusal and in `run_sec.py`'s output.
- **What compiling changed**, held in modelx in every run: each int a point's projection
  reads of `2**53` or more in size, or that `int()` cannot read where the table's checks
  let it through, is refused by the point's own accessor, in a projection and by a direct
  call, naming the point, while the table reads and every other point projects the
  committed numbers exactly, a point holding the same value outside the accessor's scope
  among them; a fraction in each int column with an `_ok` flag is refused as the table is
  read, as at stage `E`; a point the caches cannot hold, a covered life issued below
  `issue_age_min`, the joint annuitant's among them, an income start month past 1,440,
  elected or adjusted, and a certain period ending past it, is refused by `stop_mth()` in
  that order, naming the point, by every report, and projects once its bound is moved, and
  an income start month of 1,440 and a period certain ending there project at the shipped
  bound; every form issued at age 0, on age tables extended to 0, projects 1,440 months and
  is `DIA_US_S`'s point in every cell, and on a joint contract at 119 and 0, whose first
  life dies in the deferral, the pricing guarantee and every purchase rate are
  `DIA_US_S`'s by `float.hex`; `claims(t, ALL)` and `liability_outgo(t)` are `DIA_US_S`'s
  by `float.hex`, a negative zero in most months, at an A/E of −0.5; `claims_ann` is the
  plain sum of its months' claims, bit for bit, and `DIA_US_S`'s to 1e-15 relative, at the
  shipped A/E and at −0.5; the premium table is `DIA_US_S`'s dictionary by `float.hex` on a
  schedule whose rows of one month sum to a different float in another order, the pricing
  guarantee totals the premiums as `DIA_US_S`'s compensated `sum` does, a premium of 0.0
  is priced and its return-of-premium key read as `DIA_US_S` reads it, and
  `rop_deferral_yrs(k)` is `DIA_US_S`'s `round` at every half and either side of 0; each
  decode refuses each value `DIA_US_S` names written in another case or beside a space,
  with `DIA_US_S`'s message, in both models; on the four tables written in reverse, the
  improvement scale holding one sex, each table numbers its own sexes, every join reads
  its key's row, and a sex the scale lacks is refused at the first age read; the padding
  beyond each age table's extent is NaN, and each reader refuses an age below its table's
  first, naming the point, the age and the life; every `Data` cell but the readers is the
  int64 or float64 array, or the int, that the `Data` docstring's table states, and every
  parameterless projection cell returns a Python number; each size in `spec_sec.py` is the
  one its comment derives from the model's References, every 2-D cache one inner width,
  the codes dense from 0 and `Data.premium_last_mth` the spec's; the sample's recursion
  limit is the one its comment derives, and the sample calls `sex` on a second instance
  whose single life's `joint_sex` is blank; `run_sec.py`'s running sum of a block is
  `groupby`'s, bit for bit; `run_sec.py --cython` rebuilds in place exactly when a source
  is newer than the build; and outside the repository, beside a copy of the model or at a
  path too shallow to hold one, it says it cannot build.
- **No pandas in `Projection`** (C5), in `tests/test_compiled_conventions.py`, which holds
  what every `_SEC` model meets once it compiles. Read from the formulas, with no compiler:
  no cell but the reporting and engine ones refers to pandas, numpy or another module,
  reads a table with `.loc` or the like, calls a reporting cell, holds text but in its
  docstring and its refusals, or holds a generator, a comprehension or a nested function;
  none calls anything but a cell, a `Data` vector and the builtins of *What compiling
  changed, and why*, and the registry admits `round` in `purchase_rate` alone; every cell
  the registry names an engine cell takes a parameter no spec size names, or none and
  returns a list, a dictionary or a DataFrame, and no compiled cell calls one; every
  `Data` vector a formula reads is an int64 or float64 array, read by element; no cell is
  uncached; and each label accessor returns its point's column on every point, of its own
  name or as the registry's `"reporting_columns"` names it, and each such entry is needed.
- **Compiled**, where modelx-cython and a C compiler are installed, after compiling the
  model once into a temporary directory, never into the tree. In the same conventions
  module: the generated declarations give every cell but the reporting and engine ones a C
  `bint`, `long long` or `double` and a C-array cache of exactly the spec's size, and every
  new `Data` cell but a reader a typed memoryview or a C scalar, and the generated C keeps
  no Python object among a projection cell's locals, calls no Python builtin there but the
  one admitted, and builds no container, under both directives (C3); on the committed
  points, every cell at every argument a full modelx sweep caches is what modelx computes,
  bit for bit on x86-64, and so is every raise and every `Data` array (C4); and
  `run_sec.py --block`, run compiled, holds one point's ItemSpace at a time. In
  `tests/test_deferred_income_annuity_us_sec.py`: the same comparison on the splice grid,
  the core by default and the full grid with `USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`, a chunk of rows at a
  time, each with its premiums still due; at the contract's extremes, its longest frames,
  its youngest issue age and its latest income start month and guarantee end, on age
  tables extended to age 0 with a value of their own at every age and sex; where the cap on
  mortality binds, each case first shown in modelx to reach the float 1.0 and hold it, and
  where a NaN A/E reaches the cap and fails the checks; where the commutation rate's floor
  on the reference rate's change binds, the column and the Reference of opposite signs,
  first shown to bind in modelx; on keys written as floats, where every `Data` array is
  first held to its dtype and values on the keys as written, in modelx, in seconds; and on
  a single life's `joint_sex` that is a number or blank, which `sex` returns as modelx
  does. The compiled model refuses what modelx refuses, with modelx's message, on an
  extract labelled otherwise than by position, every refusal of the module among them, and
  an argument past a cache, either side, raises `IndexError`; `claims(t, ALL)` keeps
  `DIA_US_S`'s sign of zero compiled; the deepest call the contract allows runs cold on a
  1 MiB stack and on the main thread, and the test reports the smallest of nine stacks,
  256 KiB to 2 MiB, it ran on, waiting a bounded time for each; a Reference set after the
  model has computed changes no value it has cached; and `run_sec.py --cython` prints what
  `run_sec.py` prints, for a point and for the block, and refuses a directory that holds no
  build. They are marked `cython`, and they skip without the toolchain, but in the `cython`
  CI job, which installs it on Linux and on Windows, one leg a product, a skip fails,
  whatever made it.
