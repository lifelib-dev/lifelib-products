r"""The by-contract projection of :mod:`~.RILA_US_SEC`.

``RILA_US_S`` run from a valuation date. The Space is parameterized by ``idx``, the
position of a model point in the table and in every :mod:`~.RILA_US_SEC.Data` vector, as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` is: ``Projection[0]`` is an ItemSpace projecting the table's
first row, model point 1, the anchor cell issued at the valuation date, where every
number is ``RILA_US_S``'s, and :func:`point_id` is its label::

    >>> Projection[0].result_iv()          # the worked example's own table
    >>> Projection[0].result_cf()
    >>> Projection[15].result_cf()         # point 16, the anchor cell in force 71 months
    >>> Projection[0].point_id()           # 1, the row's point_id
    >>> Projection.idx = 1                 # or switch the default, before computing

Compiled, no cache is ever cleared: set ``idx``, like every Reference, on a model just
imported, before anything is computed, or project through ``Projection[i]``. modelx
recomputes what a Reference reaches when it is set; a compiled ItemSpace takes the
References when it is made and keeps every value it has computed until it is deleted,
and the base ``Projection`` and ``Data`` keep theirs for good. And it holds each Reference
as a C variable of its shipped value's type: a float set on an int Reference truncates
toward zero, and an int set on a float Reference reads as a float
(``products/registered_index_linked_annuity/model-sec.md``, *What it refuses*).

Any ``idx`` makes an ItemSpace, and none is refused here. ``Projection[-1]`` reads every
vector at its last element, as numpy and a compiled memoryview both do, so it is the
table's last point, under that point's own :func:`point_id`; an ``idx`` past the last
row raises ``IndexError`` at its first read of a vector, which modelx reports inside its
``FormulaError``.

This is :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, and then made to compile, as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` is made from ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, on the deferred
chassis :mod:`.MYGA_US_SEC` compiled first and the index crediting of
:mod:`.FIA_US_SEC`. A formula of :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on where
the projection starts, where it must answer for a month outside cover, where it compared
a timing, a kind or a switch as text, where it priced at a float argument, or where it
reads a table or text the compiled model holds as numbers; every other is
:mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s own. ``products/registered_index_linked_annuity/model-sec.md`` lists
the rewritten cells with the reason for each.

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent directory,
``products/registered_index_linked_annuity/``, read at run time rather than stored inside
the model. The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas — no ``_data/``, no
IOSpec, no embedded values — so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an input
can be edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows
``annuallife.TradLife_A``; contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs
*inside* the model through modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``RILA_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that
reads and then fails on first evaluation.

The readers and the filename References live on the sibling
:mod:`~.RILA_US_SEC.Data` Space, reached here through the ``data``
Reference, so each file is read once per model rather than once per model point. Five of
the files are ``RILA_US_S``'s, read in place; the model point table and the market
scenarios are this model's own:

=========================  ==================================  ==========================

``market_scenario`` is the input class peculiar to this product: the *contractual* formula
consumes market data, so the index level, the Market Value Rate, the risk-free rate, the
dividend yield and the implied volatility are inputs on the same footing as the
withdrawal-charge schedule, not a valuation overlay. It runs on the valuation clock
(below), and each model point restated in force or issued after the valuation date reads
its own copy of its scenario, re-based to its month.

.. rubric:: Projection basis

``t`` counts **months from the valuation date** and is **0-based**: ``t = 0`` is the
valuation month, the same month for every model point however old the contract, month
``t`` runs from time ``t`` to time ``t + 1``, and the frame is ``t = 0 … proj_len() - 1``,
so ``len(result_cf()) == proj_len()``, with ``proj_len() = maturity_mth() -
duration_mth_init()``. The **policy clock** is :func:`duration_mth`,
``duration_mth_init() + t``, the policy months elapsed at the start of month ``t``, which is
``RILA_US_S``'s ``t``: on a contract issued at the valuation date the two clocks coincide,
and every number is ``RILA_US_S``'s. Following the notes, every within-month quantity is
evaluated at the month **end**, time ``t + 1``: the market state, the interim value, the
Account Value and the benefits on row ``t`` are the values there, while ``pols_if(t)`` is
the count entering the month at time ``t``. The Issue Date opens the contract's first
month, the one with ``duration_mth(t) == 0``, so the purchase payment, the acquisition
expense and the opening state of a contract issued at or after the valuation date fall
inside that row rather than in a row of their own.

**Two clocks.** The market runs on the **valuation** clock, which every point of a block
shares: the index level, the Market Value Rate and the option-pricing market month ``t``
is valued at are the scenario's at time ``t + 1`` (:func:`market_state`), and expense
inflation steps every twelve months from the valuation date (:func:`inflation_factor`).
Everything contractual runs on the **policy** clock: the terms and their Term Start and
End Dates (:func:`term_elapsed_mth`), the Contract Anniversaries and the free-withdrawal
base snapshotted at them, the withdrawal charge and the surrender behaviour keyed to it,
the attained age, the withdrawal programme (:func:`wd_amount_pm`) and the Maturity Date
(:func:`maturity_mth`). Each test of a month against a contractual date reads
``duration_mth(t)``, and a policy month that names a month to read, a Term Start Date or
an anniversary, is turned into a month from the valuation date once, by subtracting
``duration_mth_init()``, in the one cell that reads it.

**A month-end valuation has two readings of "the contract year", and the model carries
both.** ``duration(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12`` is the *interval* reading and lifelib's
0-based duration: the complete contract years elapsed at the **start** of month ``t``,
i.e. the contract year the whole month lies inside. It is the right one for a rate that
applies across the month — the attained age behind ``q_m(t)`` (:func:`age`).
``duration_eom(t) = (duration_mth(t) + 1) // 12`` is the *instant* reading, the notes'
``cy`` at the month end: how many complete contract years have elapsed at time ``t + 1``,
where the month's transactions and decrements settle. It is the right one for the
withdrawal charge a transaction bears (:func:`surr_charge_rate`), the free-withdrawal base
snapshotted at an anniversary (:func:`free_wd_base`), and the surrender behaviour keyed to
that charge (:func:`policy_year`, :func:`lapse_rate_sc_mult`, :func:`lapse_rate_base`),
which must see the charge expire in the same month the contract does. The two differ
**only in the month that closes on an anniversary**: at policy month 11 ``duration`` is 0
but ``duration_eom`` is 1, so that month bears the age-``x`` mortality rate while a
surrender settling at its end is already on the year-2 side of the charge schedule. The
expense inflation step is the one annual step on the valuation clock instead,
``1.025^(t // 12)``, so that every point of a block carries its expenses in
valuation-date dollars.

:mod:`.MYGA_US_S` needs only one reading, because its beginning-of-month transaction
convention makes the two coincide: there the anniversary month belongs to the year that is
opening, here the anniversary closes the month that has just run, and the two products'
``policy_year`` readings differ in exactly that one month a year. Each convention is the
right one for its own timing basis.

Within month ``t`` the notes' processing order is: refresh the **market state**; apply
**term-end crediting** if ``t`` is a Term End Date; apply the **renewal / transfer** roll
split and re-strike the option; compute **interim values**; accrue the **accounts** and
set the Account Value, snapshotting the free-withdrawal base on a Contract Anniversary;
take **contract-holder transactions**; and apply **decrements** at the end of the month —
death at ``q_m(t)``, then surrender at ``w_m(t)`` on survivors **[std order]**, plus the
discrete term-end surrender fraction ``phi`` at a Term End Date.

Two conventions carry that order through the cells. Every quantity of the option bucket is
**homogeneous of degree one in the Investment Amount** — the notes require it, and the
model imposes it by holding the per-unit ratio :func:`iv_ratio` and multiplying, so a
withdrawal reduces the interim value by exactly the cash removed. And each month's
valuation refers to the option **in force during that month**, which at a Term End Date is
the *expiring* one: :func:`tau` is 0 there, not ``T``, so the replicating portfolio
collapses to intrinsic value and reproduces the crediting rate exactly.

.. rubric:: In force at the valuation date

A model point is a contract issued at the valuation date (``duration_mth_init() == 0``),
one already in force there (the months since issue), or one to be issued ``k`` months
later (``-k``), up to ``Data.future_horizon_mth`` months on. Every recursion opens at
:func:`t_entry`, the first month on the books, and none reads a month before it. A
contract issued at or after the valuation date opens as ``RILA_US_S`` opens at issue: the
purchase payment allocated wholly to the option, the general accounts empty, no free
withdrawal amount, its contracts entering as :func:`pols_new_biz` in the issue month. A
contract in force opens from the model point's opening state, what ``RILA_US_S`` carries
into the valuation month, per contract, before any month-0 event: the Investment Amount,
which is also the crediting basis, the Fixed and Holding Accounts, the Account Value, the
Free Withdrawal Amount still unused and the return-of-premium base
(:func:`inv_amt_pp_init`, :func:`fixed_acct_pp_init`, :func:`holding_acct_pp_init`,
:func:`av_pp_init`, :func:`free_wd_remain_init`, :func:`rop_pp_init`), and the Account
Value at the Contract Anniversary on or before the valuation date, the base of the
contract year's Free Withdrawal Amount (:func:`av_pp_prev_anniv_init`); its count in
force is :func:`pols_if_init`.

The **term under way** is fixed at its Term Start Date. Where that date precedes the
valuation month, its index level, its Market Value Rate and its option-pricing market are
the model point's (:func:`index_at_term_start_init` and the four beside it), and so is the
cap re-solved there at a renewal under ``nge_reset`` (:func:`cap_rate_init`): facts frozen
at a past date, which a change to the market or to a Reference at the valuation date must
not move, and which no scenario re-based to the valuation date holds. A term that starts
at or after the valuation month reads its start from the scenario, as ``RILA_US_S`` does,
and re-solves its cap there. Terms align with issue, every ``12 x term_years`` policy
months, so the Term Start Date follows from the policy clock and takes no column.
``RILA_US_S`` does not implement the Performance Lock, and this model, ``RILA_US_S`` run in
force, adds none: a contract carries no lock flag and no locked value.

The Account Value may be of **either sign**. It is the interim value plus the two
accounts, and the interim value can be negative even when the index has risen [S2], so
``Data`` accepts any finite opening Account Value and refuses instead a contract in force
that holds nothing, no investment amount and no account balance.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cell names follow lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` and ``savings.CashValue_SE``, and
this library's deferred annuity chassis :mod:`.MYGA_US_S`, wherever those have
an analogue — ``pols_*`` for policy counts, ``av_*`` for account values, plural nouns for
cash flows, ``*_rate`` for rates, ``*_pp`` for per-contract amounts, ``*_at(t, timing)``
for a quantity read at a point inside the month, ``*_init`` for a contract's opening state
at the valuation date (``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s ``pols_if_init``), ``*_pm(m)`` for a
schedule read by policy month and ``*_py(y)`` by contract year. The technical notes use
compact actuarial symbols instead. The mapping is:

.. rubric:: Names that needed care

The notes reuse single letters across three different vocabularies — contract mechanics,
Black-Scholes and the deferred annuity chassis — and the collisions are real.

``T`` is the term length in **years** while ``t`` is a **month**, so it becomes
:func:`term_years`; ``tau`` is likewise in years and stays :func:`tau`. ``P`` is both the
single purchase payment and the Black-Scholes put: :func:`premium_pp` against
:func:`bs_put`. ``C`` is the Black-Scholes call, the [S2] fixed-leg symbol for the Market
Value Rate at term start, *and* the surrender charge on the chassis: :func:`bs_call`,
:func:`mvr_at_term_start` and :func:`surr_charge_pp`. ``B`` is the amortized option budget
here and the buffer is ``b``: :func:`budget_amort_pp` against :func:`buffer`. ``R`` is
index performance and ``r`` is the Market Value Rate: :func:`index_perf` against
:func:`mvr`. ``e`` is the Edge Rate, not Euler's number: :func:`edge_rate`.

One collision is worth stating in prose because getting it wrong would be a modelling
error rather than a naming one. On the deferred annuity chassis ``M(t)`` is a **contract**
market value adjustment applied to the surrender benefit. **This product has no such
thing** — the only MVA-like term in the prospectus is the ``[(1+C)/(1+D)]^E`` factor
*inside* the interim value [S2], which is why it is named :func:`mva_factor` (a factor, in
the interim value) and there is no ``mva_pp``, no ``mva_rate`` and no ``mva_cap_rule``
anywhere in this model. The notes' ``M_sc`` and ``M_iv`` are lapse multipliers and are
named :func:`lapse_rate_sc_mult` and :func:`lapse_iv_mult` so they cannot be read as
adjustments either. Nor is there an ``mgsv_pp``: AG 54 displaces Model #805 outright when
it is satisfied [R2][REG-R42][REG-R44], and the nonforfeiture value *is* the interim
value.

.. rubric:: Timing arguments

Investment Amount, ``inv_amt_pp_at(t, timing)``:

``BEF_CREDIT``
    the notional entering month ``t``, which is what the month's valuation applies to. In
    a contract's issue month it is the purchase payment allocated to the option — the
    opening state the Issue Date leaves behind — and in the valuation month of a contract
    in force it is :func:`inv_amt_pp_init`.
``BEF_ROLL``
    after term-end crediting, ``IA(1 + g)`` at a Term End Date and unchanged otherwise.
    This is the worked example's **Investment Amount** column.
``BEF_WD``
    after the renewal / transfer roll split, so ``roll_share(OPTION)`` of
    ``BEF_ROLL`` at a Term End Date and unchanged otherwise.
``AFT_WD``
    after the proportional withdrawal reduction. Equal to :func:`inv_amt_pp`.

Interim Value, ``interim_value_pp_at(t, timing)``, takes the same three of those points —
``BEF_ROLL``, ``BEF_WD``, ``AFT_WD`` — and is in each case the Investment Amount at
that point multiplied by :func:`iv_ratio`. ``BEF_ROLL`` is the worked example's
**Interim value** column.

The currency decomposition of that value — :func:`fixed_proxy_pp`,
:func:`opt_component_pp`, :func:`deriv_proxy_pp`, :func:`trading_cost_pp` and
:func:`budget_amort_pp` — takes two of them, ``BEF_ROLL`` and ``AFT_WD``, through
:func:`iv_notional_pp`; ``RILA_US_S``'s default, ``"BEF_ROLL"``, is no default here, every
caller passing its timing. That pair is what the worked example's rows
B1 and B2 are: the same month, the same market state, the decomposition before and after
an $8,000 withdrawal, every component scaled by one factor.

Account Value, ``av_pp_at(t, timing)``, following ``CashValue_SE``'s ``av_pp_at``:

``BEF_WD``
    ``AV(t)`` as the notes' step 5 leaves it — after crediting, the roll split, the
    interim value and the account accruals, before any transaction. This is the value the
    free-withdrawal base is snapshotted from and the base the withdrawal is allocated
    across.
``AFT_WD``
    after the transaction; equal to :func:`av_pp`, and the value every decrement benefit
    is measured on.

Policy counts, ``pols_if_at(t, timing)``, following ``CashValue_SE``'s ``pols_if_at`` and
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s ``BEF_NB``:

``BEF_NB``
    the count carried in from month ``t - 1``, before month ``t``'s new business:
    :func:`pols_if_init` at :func:`t_entry`, and the survivors of month ``t - 1`` after it.
``BEF_DECR``
    ``l(t)``, in force at the **start** of month ``t``: ``BEF_NB`` plus the month's new
    business, :func:`pols_new_biz`; equal to :func:`pols_if`.
``BEF_LAPSE``
    after deaths, ``l(t)(1 - q_m(t))``.
``BEF_TERM_SURR``
    after the background monthly surrender, ``l(t)(1 - q_m)(1 - w_m)``.
``AFT_DECR``
    after the discrete term-end surrender fraction ``phi``. This is the count at the month
    **end**, the notes' ``l(t+1)``: :func:`pols_if` carries the start-of-month count, so
    the end-of-month one lives here and nowhere else.

Benefit ``kind`` arguments are ``DEATH``, ``LAPSE`` and ``MATURITY``, and ``ALL`` for the
total of :func:`claims` and :func:`claims_over_av`. Withdrawal allocation ``bucket``
arguments are ``OPTION``, ``FIXED`` and ``HOLDING``. Option ``leg`` arguments are
``ATM_CALL``, ``OTM_CALL``, ``OTM_PUT``, ``ATM_PUT``, ``FLOOR_PUT``, ``STEP_BINARY`` and
``EDGE_BINARY``. Market-state ``mkt`` arguments are ``CURRENT`` and ``TERM_START``, and a
pricing ``basis`` is one of those or ``UPDATED_EXPIRY``. Any other value of any of these
raises ``ValueError``. Each is an int code (*Codes*, below).

There is no ``"ANNUITIZATION"`` kind. The notes give no elective annuitization take-up
for this product; the only annuitization modelled is the **forced** one at the Maturity
Date, which is ``MATURITY``.

.. rubric:: pols_maturity and the Maturity Date

Unlike the deferred annuity chassis, this product's horizon is contractual rather than
chosen: the Maturity Date is the later of the anniversary after the oldest owner's 90th
birthday and ten years from issue [S2], so ``policy_term()`` is
``max(90 - age_at_entry(), 10)`` years and :func:`maturity_mth` is twelve times that, the
policy month cover ends at — 360 on the anchor cell, whose last covered policy month is
359. :func:`proj_len` counts from the valuation date to there,
``maturity_mth() - duration_mth_init()``: 360 months on the anchor cell issued at the
valuation date, the last of them ``t = 359``, and 289 on the anchor in force 71 months.
The Maturity Date is that month's end, where the contract force-annuitizes at the Account
Value, and :func:`pols_maturity` carries the survivors out, so that the roll-forward::

    pols_if(t) - pols_if_at(t + 1, BEF_NB)
        = pols_death(t) + pols_lapse(t) + pols_maturity(t)

closes for every ``t``, including the last — ``pols_if(t)`` opening month ``t`` and
``pols_if_at(t+1, BEF_NB)`` the count carried into the next, which past the Maturity
Date is zero; the next month's new business is no part of month ``t``'s movement. The name
follows ``BasicTerm_S.pols_maturity`` and the construction follows :mod:`.Term_US_S` and
:mod:`.MYGA_US_S`. The payout stream bought at that date is not derived here: it is the
immediate-annuity chassis, restricted to the two forms this contract offers [S2].

.. rubric:: Codes

What :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` spells as text, a timing, a kind, a bucket, a leg, a market, a
scenario column or a pricing rule, is here an int Reference named as the text it
replaces, the column names upper-cased, so that every cell takes and returns C numbers. A
call site reads as it did, less the quotes: ``pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)``,
``av_pp_at(t, BEF_WD)``, ``claims(t, DEATH)``, ``market_state(t + 1, RISK_FREE)``.

===============  =====  =============================================================

The timings are numbered as one family, ``BEF_NB`` 0 and ``BEF_DECR`` 1, as in every SEC
model, then the count's others, then the value cells', each in the order of its instants,
so that a timing of the count passed to a value cell, ``av_pp_at(t, BEF_NB)``, is refused
as any timing the cell does not take is, ``ValueError("invalid timing")``, in both
engines, rather than read as one of its own. The kinds are numbered in ``result_cf``'s
order, the order :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` adds them in its total, then ``ALL``, its
``kind=None``, and the guaranteed minimum's three rate kinds after it, so that a claim
kind passed to :func:`guar_min_rate`, or a rate kind to a claim cell, is refused,
``ValueError("invalid kind")``. The buckets and the legs are numbered in
:mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s order; the market of :func:`opt_component`, ``mkt``, and the basis of
:func:`opt_component_at` share ``CURRENT`` and ``TERM_START``, which :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`
spells alike. A code a cell takes indexes that cell's cache, a C array of nine codes a
month for each cell that takes a ``t`` and a code, and of seven legs by nine bases or
timings for :func:`opt_component_at` and :func:`opt_component_pp`, since every 2-D cache
of the model has one inner width and every 3-D one one inner shape (``spec_sec.py``): a
code a cell does not take but below 9, or a leg below 7, is refused inside the cache.
Codes are References, not cells, so the symbol map does not list them. Every other
Reference is named in lower case, ``issue_age_min`` and ``issue_age_max`` among them, the
issue ages 0 to 111 the compiled model's caches are sized from (:func:`proj_len`).

.. rubric:: Reporting cells

:func:`model_point`, the label accessors :func:`policy_id`, :func:`sex`,
:func:`crediting_type`, :func:`iv_family`, :func:`amort_rule`, :func:`scenario_id` and
:func:`wd_schedule_id`, the reports :func:`result_cf`, :func:`result_pols`,
:func:`result_av` and :func:`result_iv`, and the checks :func:`check_av_roll_fwd`,
:func:`check_pols_roll_fwd` and :func:`check_term_end_identity` are written for a reader
and for the comparison with :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`, which has every one of them: a table row,
text, DataFrames and three verdicts. No other cell calls them: each reads the number
``Data`` decoded from the same column instead, the decodes' flags and the rows the keys
select. So the row, the text and the frames stay Python when the model compiles. A label
accessor returns its column as read, text or not: ``Data`` accepts, and the model
projects, a point whose ``policy_id`` is blank or a number, which no cell reads, whose
``crediting_type``, ``iv_family`` or ``amort_rule`` is, which its decodes answer False to,
or whose ``scenario_id`` or ``wd_schedule_id`` is a number, where its table's keys are
numbers, and the compiled accessor returns what modelx returns, NaN or an int; ``sex`` is
always ``M`` or ``F``, which the mortality table's check holds. Every other cell returns
a C ``bint``, ``long long`` or ``double``, and so do the three checks, which may stay
Python but compile to a ``bint``, their verdict, as their per-month residuals,
``*_resid``, compile to a ``double``.

.. rubric:: Engine cells

Eleven cells of float parameters compile with C signatures and dict caches, their bodies
Python, ``math`` included: :func:`norm_cdf`, :func:`bs_d1`, :func:`bs_d2`,
:func:`bs_call`, :func:`bs_put`, :func:`bs_binary_call`, :func:`opt_component`,
:func:`opt_portfolio`, :func:`opt_portfolio_abs`, :func:`credit_rate_at` and
:func:`opt_budget_at_cap`, :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s own with its strings coded, kept for its
tests, which call :func:`opt_component`, :func:`opt_portfolio`, :func:`credit_rate_at`
and :func:`bs_binary_call` directly, for T1, which compares the keys
:mod:`~.RILA_US_S` caches, some 5,000 a point, and for a reader. No projection cell calls
them, and a cell keyed by a float compiles with a Python dict for a cache, so the registry
admits them by name. The projection prices through their int-keyed forms instead, each
written inline once: :func:`opt_component_at`, a leg on one of three bases, which
:func:`opt_portfolio_at` and :func:`opt_portfolio_abs_at` sum; :func:`credit_rate_by`, the
crediting rate under one of two rules; and :func:`cap_solved_at_start`, the cap solve,
once a term. A module test holds each to its engine cell bit for bit on every committed
point and month, and on two points under ``nge_reset`` that solve a one-year cap fifty
times on a market that steps each year. :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s ``opt_legs()``, a tuple of
leg names, which no C type holds, is dropped for :func:`opt_leg_count` and
:func:`opt_leg`, and T1 exempts it.

The two pricing cells, :func:`opt_component_at` and :func:`cap_solved_at_start`, call
``math.log``, ``math.exp``, ``math.sqrt`` and ``math.erf``, Python's own functions, which
the registry admits in those two cells alone by their dotted names (``"python_calls"``),
each wrapped in ``float(...)`` so that every local stays a C double. So a compiled price
is modelx's on every platform, and a ``math`` raise, ``exp``'s ``OverflowError`` among
them, is Python's own in both engines. C's own functions, measured on a prototype under
MSVC, were equal bit for bit and faster, and are not taken
(``products/registered_index_linked_annuity/model-sec.md``, *The compiled model*). Every
other cell calls no ``math``: the uncapped cap's ``+inf`` comes from
``Data.cap_uncapped()`` and ``math.isinf`` from :func:`is_uncapped`; and
:func:`opt_budget_target`, :func:`mva_factor`, :func:`fixed_leg_yield`,
:func:`fixed_proxy_factor` and :func:`inflation_factor` call ``math.log`` only inside the
bound check before a power (*Powers*, below), which the registry admits in each.

.. rubric:: Powers

A ``**`` of two floats is Python's in modelx, which raises where it has no float to give,
and C's ``pow`` compiled, which raises nowhere: a base of 0 under a negative power gives
``inf`` there, a negative base under a fractional power NaN, and a result past the
largest float ``inf``, where Python raises ``ZeroDivisionError``, returns a complex
number, and raises ``OverflowError``. So every power whose base inputs ``Data`` accepts,
or a moved Reference, can take there is guarded before it is taken, the same in both
engines, refusing nothing :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` projects:

* a base of 0 under a negative power raises Python's own ``ZeroDivisionError``, its own
  message, in :func:`opt_budget_target`, :func:`fixed_leg_yield` and
  :func:`fixed_proxy_factor`;
* a base below 0 under a power that is not a whole number, where :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s
  ``**`` returns a complex number, which no cell can carry on with, raises ``ValueError``
  naming the point and what took the base there: in :func:`fixed_leg_yield` on a term
  longer than a year, in :func:`fixed_proxy_factor` where the months left in the term are
  not a multiple of 12, in :func:`fixed_acct_pp_at`, :func:`fixed_acct_pp`,
  :func:`holding_acct_pp_at` and :func:`holding_acct_pp`, the accounts' twelfth root, and
  in :func:`lapse_rate_mth`. Under a whole-number power, a negative base computes as
  :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` does, and so does ``-0.0``, and any base under a power of 0 is 1;
* a power past the largest float, which Python's ``**`` refuses with a message of the
  platform's, raises ``OverflowError`` with a message of this model's, naming the point,
  before it is taken: where ``y log|x|`` exceeds ``709.7827128933845``, which is
  ``log`` of the largest float, ``709.782712893384``, and a margin of ``5e-13`` above the
  error of the product, in :func:`opt_budget_target`, :func:`fixed_leg_yield`,
  :func:`mva_factor`, :func:`fixed_proxy_factor` and :func:`inflation_factor`, and where
  a square's base exceeds ``1.3407807929942596e154``, the largest float whose square is a
  float, in :func:`opt_component_at`, :func:`cap_solved_at_start`, :func:`lapse_iv_mult`
  and the engine's :func:`bs_d1`. A base or a power that is not finite, which Python's
  ``**`` answers without a raise, is not checked. The square's bound is exact; the
  logarithm's falls within ``1e-12`` relative of Python's own overflow, and a power
  inside that sliver, which no input reaches but by construction, is refused in both:
  modelx raises Python's ``OverflowError``, with the platform's message, and the
  compiled model raises this model's, after the power, its result past the largest
  float.

Each refuses only where :mod:`~.RILA_US_S` itself raises or returns a complex number, and
``model-sec.md`` records each beside :mod:`~.RILA_US_S`'s own outcome.

    * a point at or past its Maturity Date at the valuation date has no frame, and is

    Each option's notional is the Investment Amount [S4], and every strike is set from the
    Term Start Date index level ``I_s``, so dividing by ``I_s`` makes each leg
    dimensionless and the portfolio a fraction of notional. ``mkt`` selects the market
    state: ``CURRENT`` prices at month ``t``'s month end, time ``t + 1`` on the valuation
    clock, and ``TERM_START`` under the initial market conditions of the term in force -
    its Term Start Date - which is what the option budget and the ``updated_expiry``
    amortization need. The Term Start Date's market is read through
    :func:`risk_free_at_term_start`, :func:`div_yield_at_term_start` and
    :func:`impl_vol_at_term_start`, from the model point where the term began before the
    valuation month.

    The participation rate multiplies the call spread and re-strikes the short call at
    ``I_s(1 + c/PR)`` [S4]; at ``PR = 1`` that is exactly the plain Cap portfolio, so one
    branch serves both of the notes' first two rows. An uncapped option values the
    out-of-the-money call at zero [S2]. 0.0 outside cover.

    An engine cell, ``RILA_US_S``'s formula with the leg and the market as codes: ``spot``
    and ``tau_`` are floats, so it keeps a Python dict for a cache, and no projection cell
    calls it. The projection reads :func:`opt_component_at`, the same price keyed by a
    basis code, which a module test holds to this cell bit for bit.
