# modelx: pseudo-python
# This file is part of a modelx model.

# are model formulas and may not be executable as standard Python.

"""Input data shared by every by-policy projection.

The five input CSVs are read here, **once per model**, and referenced from
:mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Projection` as ``data``. :mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Projection` is
parameterized by ``idx``, the position of a model point in the table, so each
``Projection[i]`` is a separate ItemSpace with its own cells cache; if the readers lived
there, every model point would re-read every file. Holding them in an unparameterized
Space reads each file once no matter how many policies are projected.

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs in the model folder's parent directory,
``products/term_life/``, rather than data stored inside the model. The model folder
therefore holds nothing but formulas — no ``_data/``, no IOSpec, no embedded values —
so a diff of the model shows logic changes only. This follows
``annuallife.TradLife_A``; contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs
*inside* the model through modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``Term_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and then
fails on first evaluation.

**Four of the tables are Term_US_S's.** The premium schedule, the mortality table, the
class factors and the shock-lapse buckets are the files :mod:`~.Term_US_S` reads, read
here in place: one copy of each table serves both models, so an edit to one reaches
both. The model point table is this model's own, ``model_point_table_sec.csv``; it sits
beside ``Term_US_S``'s ``model_point_table.csv``, which this model never opens.

:func:`input_dir` resolves the directory from ``_model.path.parent`` at run time, so
the model works wherever the repository is checked out. Each table has a filename
Reference and a reader Cells:

======================  ==========================  ==============================
Reference               Cells                       File
======================  ==========================  ==============================
model_point_file        model_point_table()         model_point_table_sec.csv
premium_rates_file      premium_rates()             premium_rates.csv
mort_table_file         mort_table()                mort_table.csv
class_factor_file       class_factor_table()        class_factor_table.csv
shock_lapse_file        shock_lapse_table()         shock_lapse_table.csv
======================  ==========================  ==============================

**The model point table is checked as it is read.** Two of its columns are the
in-force interface, ``policy_count`` and ``duration_mth``, and :func:`model_point_table`
refuses a table that lacks either, repeats a ``point_id``, or holds a count or a
duration no policy can have. The checks run in turn, and the first that fails raises,
naming the missing column or every point that fails it. It also refuses a policy to be
issued more than ``future_horizon_mth`` months after the valuation date, 120 months as
shipped: future new business is written over a stated horizon, so that no frame runs
longer than cover from issue plus that horizon. Set to 0, the Reference refuses future
new business altogether. A longer horizon projects in modelx, but the compiled model's
caches are sized for the shipped 120 months (``spec_sec.py``): it needs ``t`` there raised
to 12 x 77 + the horizon + 2 and a rebuild, or a frame longer than 1,044 months raises
``IndexError`` compiled, naming nothing, at the first month past the caches. Whether a
point is still in cover at the valuation date, and whether the contract issues it, are
rules of the product rather than of the table, and ``Projection.proj_len`` checks them,
against three Projection References the caches are sized from as they are from the
horizon: ``expiry_age``, ``issue_age_min`` and ``policy_term_min``.

To swap in a licensed mortality basis, replace ``mort_table.csv`` with a same-schema
file, or point ``mort_table_file`` at a different name, then clear the cache. No formula
changes. A compiled model clears no cache, so there the name is set on a package just
imported, before anything is read.

**The vectors.** The readers return what the files hold, and no
:mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Projection` cell but ``model_point``, a reporting cell, reads them.
The others read the arrays below instead, one element at a time, a model point's
attribute being the element at its position, ``data.age_at_entry()[idx]``. That is what
lets the model compile to C, as ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` does: each array is a numpy
vector or table of int64 or float64, which compiles to a typed memoryview, never one of
bools, objects or text, and each count of buckets or extent of a table is an int.

Text the projection needs is decoded here, into the number it selects: the plan into the
level period, the premium mode into the months between instalments, the underwriting
class into its mortality factor, and the face amount into its band. A blank M(1)
override becomes a 0/1 flag beside a value, so no NaN reaches a formula. And each table
keyed by more than a number becomes an integer-indexed array. The premium schedules,
keyed by plan, sex, class and band, are numbered, each point carrying the number of its
own, and tabled by schedule and policy year. The mortality table is padded from age 0, so
that the index is the attained age:

**An array is read by element, never whole,** in this Space as in
:mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Projection`. The compiler types an array cell as a memoryview only
once it has seen that every use of it, in either Space, is an element read: one
``len()``, slice, loop over it or numpy call on it anywhere, and the cell compiles as a
Python object. So an array derived here from another reads the table's column, as
:func:`band` reads ``sum_assured``, or the other cell element by element, as
:func:`premium_schedule` reads :func:`band`; and a width comes from a table, never from
another cell's array.

**What cannot be decoded is refused** when the array is first read, naming every point
at fault: a ``point_id`` that is not a whole number, a plan whose number of years ``int``
cannot read, a premium mode other than A, SA, Q or M, a class *class_factor_table.csv*
lacks, an M(1) override that is neither a number nor blank. So is a table the arrays
cannot hold: a premium schedule whose policy years are not whole, leave a gap, repeat or
start below 1, or a blank premium; a mortality table with an age that is not whole, a
gap, a repeated or negative age, or a blank rate; a shock-lapse table with no bucket.
``Term_US_S`` met each of these only when a projection reached it, or, for a blank
premium, projected NaN from it. A key written as a float, a policy year ``1.0`` or an age
``35.0``, is read by its value, as ``Term_US_S``'s lookups match it, and so is every key
an extent is taken from: a key written as text is not whole, and the table's extents
refuse it as its array does. A read beyond a table's extent is refused where
``Term_US_S``'s lookup raised ``KeyError``, by the one :mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Projection`
cell that reads the table, naming the point: ``premium_pp_ann_py`` and
``mort_rate_base``.
