# modelx: pseudo-python
# This file is part of a modelx model.
# It can be imported as a Python module, but functions defined herein
# are model formulas and may not be executable as standard Python.

"""The by-policy projection of the :mod:`~.Term_US_SEC` model; holds all formulas.

The Space is parameterized by ``idx``, the position of a model point in the table and in
every :mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Data` vector, as ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` is: ``Projection[3]``
is an ItemSpace projecting the table's fourth row, model point 4, the anchor cell in force
126 months at the valuation date, and :func:`point_id` is its label::

    >>> Projection[3].result_cf()          # one row per month from the valuation date
    >>> Projection[3].result_pols()        # the counts behind it
    >>> Projection[3].point_id()           # 4, the row's point_id
    >>> Projection.idx = 1                 # or switch the default, before it computes

Compiled, no cache is ever cleared: set ``idx``, like every Reference, on a model just
imported, before anything is computed, or project through ``Projection[i]``. modelx
recomputes what a Reference reaches when it is set; a compiled ItemSpace takes the
References when it is made and keeps every value it has computed until it is deleted,
and the base ``Projection`` and ``Data`` keep theirs for good.

Any ``idx`` makes an ItemSpace, and none is refused here. ``Projection[-1]`` reads every
vector at its last element, as numpy and a compiled memoryview both do, so it is the
table's last point, under that point's own :func:`point_id`; an ``idx`` past the last
row raises ``IndexError`` at its first read of a vector, which modelx reports inside its
``FormulaError``.

This is :mod:`~.Term_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, and then made to compile, as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` is made from ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``. A formula of
:mod:`~.Term_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on where the projection starts, where it
must answer for a month outside cover, or where it read a month far ahead of its own, and
:func:`mort_rate` caps the annual rate at 1, where :mod:`~.Term_US_S`'s passes it. The cap
puts its bound second, ``min(q, 1.0)``, and so do the ``min`` of the notes' M(1) rule and
the ``max`` of the PLT grading, :func:`plt_mort_factor_init_formula` and
:func:`plt_mort_factor`, so that a NaN stays NaN; wherever its argument is a number, each
is the float it would be with its bound first. Every other formula is
:mod:`~.Term_US_S`'s own. ``products/term_life/model-sec.md`` lists the rewritten cells
with the reason for each. Making it compile changed how each cell reads its inputs and
spells its codes, and no number: every model point attribute a projection cell uses is
read as a number from a ``Data`` vector, every table as an array indexed by integers, and
every timing and phase is an int code (*Codes*, below).

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent
directory, ``products/term_life/``, read at run time rather than stored inside the
model. The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas — no ``_data/``, no
IOSpec, no embedded values — so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an
input can be edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows
``annuallife.TradLife_A``; contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs
*inside* the model through modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``Term_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and then
fails on first evaluation. A test asserts this by round-tripping the model together
with its inputs.

:func:`~.Term_US_SEC.Data.input_dir` resolves the directory from
``_model.path.parent`` at run time, so the model works wherever the repository is
checked out. The four assumption tables are the files :mod:`~.Term_US_S` reads, read in
place; the model point table is this model's own. Each table has a filename Reference
and a reader Cells:

======================  ==========================  ==============================
Reference               Cells                       File
======================  ==========================  ==============================
model_point_file        data.model_point_table()    model_point_table_sec.csv
premium_rates_file      data.premium_rates()        premium_rates.csv
mort_table_file         data.mort_table()           mort_table.csv
class_factor_file       data.class_factor_table()   class_factor_table.csv
shock_lapse_file        data.shock_lapse_table()    shock_lapse_table.csv
======================  ==========================  ==============================

To swap in a licensed mortality basis, replace ``mort_table.csv`` with a same-schema
file, or point ``mort_table_file`` at a different name. No formula changes. Replacing
the file changes :mod:`~.Term_US_S` too, which reads the same one.

No cell here but :func:`model_point`, a reporting cell, reads the readers' DataFrames,
and the label accessors read through it. Every other reads :mod:`~.Term_US_SEC.Data`'s
vectors and arrays, one element at a time: a model point's attribute at its position,
``data.age_at_entry()[idx]``, decoded already into the number the formula needs; the
premium schedule at ``data.premium_rates_array()[premium_schedule(), y]``; the mortality
table at the attained age, ``data.mort_table_array()[age(t)]``. ``Data``'s docstring
lists them.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cells names follow lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` wherever that model has an
analogue — ``pols_*`` for policy counts, plural nouns for cash flows, ``*_rate`` for
rates, ``*_pp`` for per-policy amounts — and, for the monthly grid, the
``duration_mth`` / ``duration`` / ``policy_year`` triple that ``savings.CashValue_SE``
and the UL family in this library use. What running in force adds is named as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` names it: ``duration_mth`` read from the model point,
``policy_count``, ``pols_new_biz``, ``pols_if_at`` with its ``BEF_NB`` and ``BEF_DECR``
timings, ``is_active`` and ``result_pols``. ``duration_mth_init``, the policy months
completed at the valuation date, takes ``UL_US_S``'s name; ``t_entry`` and
``expiry_mth`` are this model's own. What compiling adds is named as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`` names it: ``idx``, ``point_id`` and the ``Data`` vectors under
their columns' names. A cell keyed by policy year rather than by month carries ``_py``.
The technical notes use compact actuarial symbols instead.

.. rubric:: Two clocks

``t`` counts months from the **valuation date**, 0-based, the clock
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` runs on: ``t = 0`` is the valuation month for every model
point, however old the policy, period ``t`` runs from time ``t`` to time ``t + 1``, and
the frame is ``t = 0 .. proj_len() - 1``, where :func:`proj_len` counts the months from
the valuation date to the end of cover. Row ``t`` is the same month for every point, so
the frames of a block line up and sum row by row.

``duration_mth(t)`` counts **policy months**, the months the policy has been in force at
time ``t``: ``duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``, where
:func:`duration_mth_init` is read from the model point — positive for a policy in force
at the valuation date, 0 for one issued at it, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months later,
at most ten years later. It is the technical notes' month index. Everything contractual
reads it: the completed policy years ``duration(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12``, the
contractual 1-based label ``policy_year(t) = duration(t) + 1``, the attained age
``age(t) = age_at_entry() + duration(t)``, and through them the premium schedule, the
ART renewals, the shock lapse, the conversion window and the commission scale. The
anchor cell in force 126 months is in policy year 11 at attained age 45 at ``t = 0``,
and pays its next premium at ``t = 6``, its eleventh anniversary.

One input reads the valuation clock instead: expense inflation,
``inflation_factor(t) = (1 + inflation_rate) ** (t / 12)``, so that the maintenance
charge is in valuation-date dollars for every point alike. Acquisition is a flat
``expense_acq`` per policy issued, charged in the issue month and not inflated, as in
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``.

On a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and this model computes what
:mod:`~.Term_US_S` computes, but for one difference by design: acquisition is charged
per policy issued, where :mod:`~.Term_US_S` charges it once per model point, whatever
the count. The two agree on :mod:`~.Term_US_S`'s own model points, which count one
policy each: there every cell the two share agrees at every argument
:mod:`~.Term_US_S` evaluates in its sweep, but for two whose meaning changed,
``pols_if_init``, now the count already in force at the valuation date, and
``model_point``, a row of another table. That is how the S worked example carries over,
and ``tests/test_model_conventions.py`` asserts it cell by cell. Where
:mod:`~.Term_US_S`'s annual mortality passes 1 its monthly rate is complex, and this model
caps the annual rate at 1 instead (:func:`mort_rate`), which changes no value
:mod:`~.Term_US_S` computes as a real number but the annual rate itself.

.. rubric:: Counts

``pols_if(t)`` is the count that weights row ``t``: ``pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)``, the
count carried in from ``t - 1`` (``BEF_NB``) plus the month's new business,
:func:`pols_new_biz`, before the month's decrements. A point in force at the valuation
date opens with :func:`pols_if_init`, its ``policy_count``; one issued at or after the
valuation date opens with none, and takes its ``policy_count`` as new business in its
issue month. The recursion's base is :func:`t_entry`, the first month on the books, and
nothing is counted outside cover (:func:`is_active`): before issue every count, and so
every cash flow, is zero.

.. rubric:: Codes

What :mod:`~.Term_US_S` spells as text, a timing or a phase, is here an int Reference
named as the text it replaces, so that every cell takes and returns C numbers. A call
site reads as it did, less the quotes: ``pols_if_at(t, BEF_DECR)``.

=============  =====  ===========================================================
Reference      Value  Meaning
=============  =====  ===========================================================
BEF_NB         0      :func:`pols_if_at`: the count carried in from month t - 1
BEF_DECR       1      :func:`pols_if_at`: that count plus month t's new business
PRE_ISSUE      0      :func:`phase`: before issue
LEVEL          1      :func:`phase`: in the level period
PLT            2      :func:`phase`: after the level period, before expiry
EXPIRED        3      :func:`phase`: from the month cover has ended
=============  =====  ===========================================================

A code a cell takes indexes that cell's cache, a C array of two timings a month for
``pols_if_at``, so codes are numbered densely from 0. Timings are numbered in the order of
their instants within the month, ``BEF_NB`` before ``BEF_DECR``, as in every SEC model,
and phases in their natural order. They are References, not cells, so the symbol map
below does not list them.

.. rubric:: Reporting cells

:func:`model_point`, the label accessors :func:`sex`, :func:`rate_class`, :func:`plan`
and :func:`premium_mode`, and the reports :func:`result_cf`, :func:`result_cf_annual` and
:func:`result_pols` return Python values, a table row, text and DataFrames, for a reader
and for the comparison with :mod:`~.Term_US_S`, which has every one of them but
:func:`result_pols`. No cell but these calls them: every other reads the number ``Data``
decoded from the same column instead, the plan's level period, the mode's cycle, the
class's factor, the schedule the four keys select. So they stay Python when the model
compiles, and every other cell returns a C ``bint``, ``long long`` or ``double``.

.. rubric:: Symbols

The two-speed structure is the library's convention, asserted by
``tests/test_model_conventions.py``: ``mort_rate(t)`` and ``lapse_rate(t)`` are the
**annual** rates of the policy year containing month ``t`` — the vectors the technical
notes tabulate — and ``mort_rate_mth(t)`` and ``lapse_rate_mth(t)`` are the monthly
rates actually applied, ``1 - (1 - q)^(1/12)``. The notes' month index is this model's
``duration_mth(t)``. The mapping is:

Three notes on the mapping. The notes write deaths as ``d(t)`` while also using ``d``
as the post-level-term duration index in ``M(d)``; the ``pols_death`` / ``plt_mort_factor``
split removes that collision. The notes' ``x(t)`` (lapses) and ``X(t)`` (premium tax)
differ only by case, which ``pols_lapse`` and ``premium_taxes`` separate. And
``pols_maturity`` has no symbol in the notes at all — see below.

.. rubric:: The shock lapse is not spread

Every ordinary decrement is converted to a monthly rate at ``1 - (1 - q)^(1/12)``, so
twelve months of it compound back to exactly the annual rate the notes tabulate. The
shock lapse is the one exception the notes make explicitly: it is **not** spread, but
applied in full at the end of the final level-period month, the month whose
``duration_mth(t)`` is ``12n - 1``, immediately before the first ART premium falls due
at ``12n``. Its policy year's annual rate ``w(n-1)`` *is* the shock, so
:func:`lapse_rate_mth` returns zero in the other eleven months of that year and the
shock itself in the last one.

That is what makes the two grids reconcile: because the ordinary monthly rates
compound to the annual ones and the shock falls at a year boundary, the in-force
**at every policy anniversary** is identical to the annual-step model's, to
floating-point. The cash flows are not identical and are not meant to be: claims now
fall at the end of the month of death rather than the end of the policy year,
maintenance expense accrues monthly, and a modal premium is collected when it is
contractually due. Those timing differences are the reason for the monthly grid.
:func:`result_cf_annual` sums the frame into policy years so the two can be laid side
by side.

.. rubric:: Premium mode

``premium_pp(t)`` is the premium **actually collected in month t**: the model point's
``premium_mode`` picks the modal factor (:func:`modal_factor`) and the payment months
(:func:`prem_cycle`) — annual in month 0 of each policy year, semi-annual every sixth
month, quarterly every third, monthly every month — and the annualized guaranteed
premium ``AP(t)`` the notes tabulate is :func:`premium_pp_ann`. Modal loading is
inside the factor (twelve monthly payments come to 0.99996 of the annual premium, two
semi-annual instalments to 1.04 of it) exactly as the specimen prints it [S6]. The
jump ratio and the conversion credit are both on ``AP``, which is what keeps them
mode-independent; commission is a *rate* keyed by policy year applied to the premium
actually collected, so a modal payer earns it in instalments too.

.. rubric:: pols_maturity

The notes give the roll-forward as ``l(t+1) = l(t)(1-q_m)(1-cv_m)(1-w_m)`` and,
separately, the rule ``l(t) = 0 for x + duration(t) >= 95``. Those do not reconcile in
the last covered month, ``duration_mth(t) = expiry_mth() - 1``: its survivors neither
die, lapse nor convert — their coverage simply runs out. Without a term for that, the
roll-forward appears to lose lives with no cause. ``pols_maturity(t)`` names it, zero
in every month but that one, so that::
