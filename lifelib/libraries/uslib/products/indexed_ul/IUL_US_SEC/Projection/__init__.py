"""The by-policy monthly projection of the :mod:`~.IUL_US_SEC` model.

The Space is parameterized by ``point_id``, so ``Projection[7]`` is an ItemSpace
projecting model point 7, ``IUL_US_S``'s monthly-premium point restated 65 months on, in
force at the valuation date with all twelve index segments live::

    >>> Projection[1].result_av()          # the account value roll-forward
    >>> Projection[7].result_seg()         # the segment ladder, carried in
    >>> Projection.point_id = 2            # or switch the default

Switch the default, as any Reference, before the model computes anything.

This is :mod:`~.IUL_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``. A formula of
:mod:`~.IUL_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on the month its frame opens at, where it
must answer for a month outside cover, where it reads the index path, or where it reads a
table at a policy year or an attained age; every other is :mod:`~.IUL_US_S`'s own.
``products/indexed_ul/model-sec.md`` lists the rewritten cells with the reason for each.

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent
directory, ``products/indexed_ul/``, read at run time rather than stored inside the
model. The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas -- no ``_data/``, no
IOSpec, no embedded values -- so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an
input can be edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows
``annuallife.TradLife_A``; contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs
*inside* the model through modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``IUL_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and then
fails on first evaluation.

The readers live in the unparameterized :mod:`~.IUL_US_SEC.Data` Space, reached here
through the ``data`` Reference, so each file is read once per model rather than once
per model point. The six assumption tables are the files :mod:`~.IUL_US_S` reads, read
in place; the model point table and the segment ladder are this model's own:

======================  ================================  ==========================

The index path is **not** a file. The base deterministic run generates
:func:`index_level` from a level annual return, and a historical or simulated path is
substituted by overriding that one cell, before the model computes anything.

.. rubric:: Two clocks

``t`` counts months from the **valuation date**, 0-based, the clock
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` runs on: ``t = 0`` is the valuation month for every model
point, however old the policy, month ``t`` runs from the monthiversary at time ``t`` to
the next, and the frame is ``t = 0, 1, ..., proj_len() - 1``, where :func:`proj_len`
counts the months from the valuation date to the end of the projection. Row ``t`` is the
same month for every point, so the frames of a block line up and sum row by row.

``duration_mth(t)`` counts **policy months**, the notes' own month index from issue:
``duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``, where :func:`duration_mth_init` is read
from the model point -- positive for a policy in force at the valuation date, in any month
of its policy year, 0 for one issued at it, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months later, at
most ten years later. Everything contractual reads it: the anniversary premium
(``duration_mth(t) % 12 == 0``), the first policy years of the withdrawal and the loan,
the maturity of a segment twelve policy months after its creation, the surrender charge's
month, the no-lapse period and its expiry shock, the GPT and 7-pay years, the COI scale
and the lapse table by policy year, the mortality rate and the corridor factor at the
attained age, the policy-year steps of the per-unit charge and of the collateral's
credited rate, the cessation of premiums and charges at ``charges_cease_age`` and the end
of the projection at ``maturity_age``. The policy year is the 1-based contractual label
``policy_year(t) = duration(t) + 1`` and the attained age (ANB) is
``age(t) = age_at_entry() + duration(t)``, both derived and never indexed by. Point 7,
``IUL_US_S``'s point 4 restated 65 months on, is in policy year 6 at attained age 50 at
``t = 0``, and point 12, to be issued 25 months after the valuation date, is issued at
``t = 25``.

``IUL_US_S`` already counts its months from the start of its own projection rather than
from issue, but ships no point in force, and its in-force entry loses what a policy's past
has left it: it opens the fixed account at the account value less the loan, the loan
collateral at the loan, the face at issue, both premium accumulators at 0, and no index
segment before its first month. What the valuation clock adds is that ``t = 0`` is one
instant for every point, that a point may be issued after it, and that a point in force
brings in its whole state: the fixed account and the collateral apart from the loan, the
face in force, the premiums paid to date and the no-lapse accumulator, whether it has
failed the 7-pay test, and its live index segments.

The economic inputs read the valuation clock. The index path,
``index_level(t) = index_level_init x (1 + index_return_ann)^(t / 12)``, is one path for
every point, whose level at the valuation date is ``index_level_init``; ``IUL_US_S``
reads it at ``duration_mth(t)``, a path of each point's own from its issue. The cap in
force (:func:`index_cap_at`) and the fixed-account rate (:func:`fixed_rate_ann`) are read
at ``t``, and are level as shipped. Expense inflation is
``inflation_factor(t) = (1 + inflation_rate)^(t // 12)``, ``IUL_US_S``'s step by policy
year moved onto ``t``, so that the maintenance expense is in valuation-date dollars for
every point alike; it is 0 as shipped. Acquisition is charged per policy issued, in the
issue month, and is not inflated, as in ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``. The collateral's
credited rate and the per-unit charge step on the policy year, as terms of the contract.

A segment's credit is a ratio of two index levels, its level at maturity over its level at
creation, so moving the path onto the valuation clock moves no credit. A segment created
in the frame, at month ``t - 12``, reads ``index_level(t - 12)`` and the cap declared then,
``index_cap_at(t - 12)``; a segment created before the valuation date carries its start
level on the same path, the level ``IUL_US_S`` reads at its creation rebased so that the
path's level at the valuation date is ``index_level_init``, and the cap declared at its
creation (:func:`seg_index_start`, :func:`seg_index_cap`). What does move is the level
itself: on a point in force ``d`` months, ``index_level(t)`` is ``IUL_US_S``'s level at its
month ``t + d`` divided by ``(1 + index_return_ann)^(d / 12)``, and so is the
``index_level`` column of :func:`result_seg`.

On a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and this model computes what
:mod:`~.IUL_US_S` computes: every cell the two share agrees at every argument
:mod:`~.IUL_US_S` evaluates in its sweep, but for four whose meaning changed:
``pols_if_init``, now the count already in force at the valuation date, ``model_point``,
a row of another table, ``result_pols``, which gains the month's new business, and
``check_margin``, whose identity this model states with the debt a surrender recovers (see
:func:`check_margin`). ``tests/test_model_conventions.py`` asserts it cell by cell.

The **value** state variables are closing balances at the end of month ``t``, the notes'
``X_{t+1}``: :func:`av_pp`, :func:`fa_pp`, :func:`lca_pp`, :func:`loan_bal_pp`,
``seg_bal_pp(t, m)``, :func:`sum_assured_at`, and the two premium accumulators,
:func:`cum_prem_pp` and :func:`cum_prem_net_pp`. The opening value of a month, the notes'
``X_t``, is the ``"BEF_PREM"`` timing of :func:`av_pp_at`, :func:`fa_pp_at` and
:func:`lca_pp_at`, or the previous month's value of the others, and at :func:`t_entry`,
the first month on the books, the model point's opening state instead, so that nothing is
ever asked for a month before the valuation date or before issue. For a point in force the
opening state is its row and its segments, per policy, as the policy stands at the start
of month 0, before any month-0 event: the account value and the loan, ``IUL_US_S``'s own
columns (:func:`av_pp_init`, :func:`loan_bal_init`); the fixed account and the loan
collateral (:func:`fa_pp_init`, :func:`lca_pp_init`); the face in force
(:func:`sum_assured_init`); the premiums less withdrawals paid to date and the no-lapse
accumulator, premiums less withdrawals and loans (:func:`cum_prem_init`,
:func:`cum_prem_net_init`); the MEC latch (:func:`is_mec_init`); and each live segment's
balance, deductions and draws to date, start level and cap, from the segment ladder (see
*The segment ladder*, below). At a mid-year valuation the current year's anniversary
premium and loan draw are already inside them. For a point issued at or after the
valuation date every one of them is 0, and the issue values come from the formulas, as
in ``IUL_US_S``.

Every chain is one cell a month. Each opening timing forms the previous month's close
itself, from its own value at ``t - 1`` and month ``t - 1``'s premium, credit, draws,
deduction, sweep and interest, the same operations in the same order as the closing cell
``IUL_US_S`` calls for, rather than calling for it: the account value's, where
``IUL_US_S``'s chain ran through five cells a month, the fixed account's, through six,
and the collateral's, through two. The loan, the face, the two premium accumulators, the
MEC latch, each segment's balance and running totals, and the count call themselves at
``t - 1``, one cell a month. A compiled model runs these chains on the C stack.

Within each month the notes' monthiversary order is followed exactly:

1. **Anniversary resets and premium.** The attained age and the corridor factor move
   on the policy anniversary (:func:`age`, :func:`corridor_factor`); the annual
   premium is received at BOM of the first month of each policy year and its load
   deducted (:func:`premium_pp`, :func:`prem_to_av_pp`), the net premium going to the
   fixed account.
2. **Segment maturity.** A segment created twelve months earlier matures: its index
   credit is computed (:func:`index_credit_pp`) and its whole value rolls into the
   fixed account (:func:`seg_roll_pp`), from which the sweep at step 7 re-enters it
   into a new segment under the standing instruction **[std]**.
3. **Withdrawals and new loans** are sourced fixed-account-first, then pro rata across
   live segments (:func:`draw_from_fa_pp`, :func:`draw_from_seg_pp`) -- the order one
   carrier gives for loans [S3]; for withdrawals, which that carrier takes pro rata
   across all unloaned accounts [S3], it is **[std]**; loan
   collateral moves into :func:`lca_pp`.
4. **Death benefit and corridor** on the post-premium, post-withdrawal account value
   (:func:`db_pp`).
5. **Net amount at risk**, the death benefit discounted one month at the
   **guaranteed** rate less the account value measured **before** the deduction
   (:func:`net_amt_at_risk`) -- the universal life base convention.
6. **Monthly deduction** (:func:`mth_deduction_pp`), sourced the same way as step 3
   (:func:`mth_deduction_from_fa_pp`, :func:`mth_deduction_from_seg_pp`), then the
   shortfall / no-lapse test (:func:`is_shortfall`).
7. **Sweep.** ``w_ix`` times the remaining fixed-account balance creates the new
   segment of this month (:func:`sweep_pp`, :func:`seg_new_pp`).
8. **Interest, EOM.** One month at the fixed-account rate on the post-sweep fixed
   balance and at the loan collateral rate on the collateral account
   (:func:`inv_income_pp`); **segments earn no interim interest** [S2]; loan interest
   accrues (:func:`loan_bal_pp`).
9. **Decrements, EOM**, death before lapse (:func:`pols_death`, :func:`pols_lapse`).

Cash flows are **undiscounted**. Premiums, expenses and premium taxes fall at BOM and
are weighted by :func:`pols_if`, the count in force at the **start** of month ``t``;
death claims by ``pols_if(t) * mort_rate_mth(t)``; surrender payments by
``pols_if(t) * (1 - mort_rate_mth(t)) * lapse_rate_mth(t)``; and partial withdrawals by
``pols_if(t)`` again, because a withdrawal is taken at BOM on the owner's election and
is not a decrement.

.. rubric:: Counts

``pols_if(t)`` is the count that weights row ``t``: ``pols_if_at(t, "BEF_DECR")``, the
count carried in from ``t - 1`` (``"BEF_NB"``) plus the month's new business,
:func:`pols_new_biz`, before the month's decrements. A point in force at the valuation
date opens with :func:`pols_if_init`, its ``policy_count``; one issued at or after the
valuation date opens with none, and takes its ``policy_count`` as new business in its
issue month. The recursion's base is :func:`t_entry`, and before issue
(:func:`is_active`) every count, and so every cash flow, is zero, and so is every value
state. ``IUL_US_S`` already names three timings, in a cell that returns ``pols_if(t)``
for each and that nothing calls. ``"BEF_DECR"`` keeps that meaning, and so does
``"BEF_MAT"``, the count before any maturity, since nothing matures: the name keeps its
S model's meaning, as in the family's other models, and ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s
start-of-month ``"BEF_MAT"`` is not adopted. ``"BEF_NB"`` is the one timing this model
gives a new meaning, ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s, and it differs from ``IUL_US_S``'s
only in the issue month, where it counts the issued policies as new business, not yet
in. Inside the month the decrements are :mod:`~.IUL_US_S`'s, in its order: death, then
surrender. No policy is terminated for insufficiency, as in ``IUL_US_S``.

.. rubric:: The end of the projection

The frame ends at :func:`maturity_mth`, the policy month at attained age
``maturity_age``, 121, the notes' [unverified] maturity inference (spec F5), and not at an
event of the contract, which is described as continuing in force with no further charges
at 121. Premiums, withdrawals and charges stop at ``charges_cease_age``, a Reference of
its own, 121 too as shipped; set below ``maturity_age``, the projection runs on past the
cessation, the account value earning its interest and the segments their credits with
nothing deducted. The roll-forwards read the survivors of the last month:
:func:`check_av_roll_fwd` and :func:`av_change` read the opening account value in force
of month ``t + 1``, which in the last month is ``t = proj_len()``. So the two opening
values they read there, the count (the ``"BEF_NB"`` timing of :func:`pols_if_at`, and
through it :func:`pols_if`) and the account value (``av_pp_at(t, "BEF_PREM")``), are
defined for ``0 <= duration_mth(t) <= maturity_mth()``: on the books, and in the month
after the frame, where they are the survivors of the last month and the account value they
carry. Each equals :mod:`~.IUL_US_S`'s value there exactly. Every other cell is zero or
false there, as before issue: each account inside the month and its opening value, each
segment, the loan, the face, every charge, premium, withdrawal, loan draw, credit,
decrement rate, decrement, claim and flow, and the expenses, whose maintenance would
otherwise fall on the carried count; only the two clocks, the inputs read on the valuation
clock and the neutral 1.0 of the two lapse multipliers hold values there. And nothing
reads past ``t = proj_len()``: :func:`av_change` and the residual cells of the checks,
which read ``t + 1`` or are read beside cells that do, are zero outside cover before they
read it.

.. rubric:: The segment ladder

A segment is created at every monthiversary from the sweep and matures twelve months
later, so between step 2 and step 7 of any month eleven segments are live and after the
sweep twelve are -- the "up to 12 segments" of [S4]. Segments are indexed by their
creation month ``m``, a **policy** month, ``duration_mth`` of the month of the sweep that
created them: ``seg_bal_pp(t, m)`` is the balance at the end of month ``t`` of
the segment born in policy month ``m``, and is zero outside
``m <= duration_mth(t) <= m + 11``. A parameter that holds a policy month is named ``m``,
never ``t``, so that what moves with the valuation clock is ``t`` alone.

A point in force at the valuation date carries its live segments in a companion of the
model point table, ``inforce_segments_sec.csv``, one row a segment, keyed by ``point_id``
and ``slot``: the months since the segment's creation at the valuation date, 1 to 12, so
that the segment in slot ``k`` is the one born in policy month ``duration_mth_init() - k``
and the segment in slot 12 matures at ``t = 0``. Every month of the last
``min(12, duration_mth_init())`` holds a row, a month that swept nothing included, at
zero, since the credited rate of a month reads the start level and the cap of the segment
maturing then whether or not it holds a balance (:func:`cred_rate_ann`). Each row gives
the segment's balance entering month 0 (:func:`seg_bal_pp_init`), the deductions and the
draws -- withdrawals and loan transfers -- charged to it since its creation
(:func:`seg_ded_cum_pp_init`, :func:`seg_wd_cum_pp_init`), which with the balance are its
credit base, the index level at its creation on the valuation-clock path
(:func:`seg_index_start_init`) and the cap declared then (:func:`seg_index_cap_init`). Its
creation balance takes no column: nothing may enter or leave a segment but a deduction, a
withdrawal or a loan transfer, so it is the three summed, which is the closure
:func:`check_seg_ladder` asserts (:func:`seg_new_pp`).

Two properties of this arrangement are worth stating because the notes list both as
pitfalls.

Each segment carries **its own index start level**, so twelve segments a year mature at
twelve different point-to-point returns. Collapsing them into one annual segment
mis-times credits and distorts mid-segment surrender values [S3]; :func:`check_seg_ladder`
and model point 3 (indexed allocation 0%) exist so the difference is visible rather than
assumed.

Deductions and withdrawals are sourced from the fixed account first and then **pro rata
across live segments** on their remaining balances **[std]**. Because a pro-rata draw
leaves the proportions unchanged, one set of shares (:func:`seg_share`) serves both the
step-3 draw and the step-6 deduction. The two claims on the pool are **ordered, not
parallel**: the step-6 deduction is capped against what the step-3 draw leaves behind,
so their sum can never exceed the pool, no segment balance can go negative, and no
segment can pay a negative index credit at maturity. Capping both against the same
pre-draw pool is the easy mistake, and :func:`check_seg_ladder` asserts against it.
The credit base under the baseline convention is exactly the remaining balance --
amounts that left the segment mid-term earn no index credit [S3]. The alternative
convention the notes price, one carrier's adjusted-beginning-value with half-weighted
deductions [S3], is the ``"ADJ_BEGIN"`` argument of :func:`seg_credit_base`.

A segment can close a month on a rounding about zero, a balance of the order of 1e-16 of
either sign, where a draw or a deduction took exactly what it held. :func:`seg_share` and
:func:`seg_count` read such a balance by ``IUL_US_S``'s own tests of zero, and the pool
:func:`seg_bal_active_pp` and the total :func:`seg_bal_tot_pp` sum the segments in an
explicit loop that compensates as Python's ``sum()`` of floats does from Python 3.12, so
that each is ``IUL_US_S``'s sum bit for bit there. Python 3.11's ``sum()`` is a plain
fold, which can leave such a pool on the other side of zero, so the states ``IUL_US_S``
closes on a rounding about zero depend on the interpreter it runs on.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cells names follow :mod:`~.UL_US_S` -- the chassis these notes defer to -- and
through it lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` and ``savings.CashValue_SE``: ``pols_*``
for policy counts, ``av_*`` for account values, plural nouns for cash flows, ``*_rate``
for rates, ``*_pp`` for per-policy amounts, ``timing`` and ``kind`` string arguments.
Every concept shared with the chassis carries the chassis name. The names that are new
in ``IUL_US_S`` are the ones the indexed crediting engine needs: the fixed (holding)
account, the segment ladder, the crediting formula, and the no-lapse guarantee test.

What running in force adds is named as ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` names it:
``duration_mth`` read from the model point, ``policy_count``, ``pols_new_biz``,
``pols_if_at`` with its ``"BEF_NB"`` timing, ``is_active`` and ``result_pols``.
``t_entry``, the first month on the books, is the SEC models' own, and ``maturity_mth`` is
named for ``maturity_age``, where the projection ends. A column of the opening state is
the cell it opens with ``_init`` added: ``av_pp_init`` and ``loan_bal_init`` are
``IUL_US_S``'s own, and ``fa_pp_init``, ``lca_pp_init``, ``sum_assured_init``,
``cum_prem_init``, ``cum_prem_net_init`` and ``is_mec_init`` open :func:`fa_pp_at`,
:func:`lca_pp_at`, :func:`sum_assured_at`, :func:`cum_prem_pp`, :func:`cum_prem_net_pp`
and :func:`is_mec` as they open theirs. A column of the segment ladder is the segment
cell it opens with ``_init`` added, keyed by the slot: ``seg_bal_pp_init(k)``,
``seg_ded_cum_pp_init(k)`` and ``seg_wd_cum_pp_init(k)``; the start level and the cap,
which no cell of ``IUL_US_S`` holds per segment, are ``seg_index_start_init(k)`` and
``seg_index_cap_init(k)``, and the monthly cells that read them, for the segment maturing
in month ``t``, :func:`seg_index_start` and :func:`seg_index_cap`. A table read at an
attained age has one reader keyed by the age, ``<cell>_at(a)``, and a table read at a
policy year one keyed by the year, ``<cell>_py(y)``; the monthly cell keeps
``IUL_US_S``'s name and calls its reader inside cover. The surrender-charge schedule,
keyed by its ID, has one reader for each of its two columns, :func:`surr_charge_rate_max`
and :func:`surr_charge_runoff_years`. A check's residual in month ``t`` is
``<check>_resid(t)``. Each text column a monthly cell branches on is read through bool
decodes, one for each value, named for the value: :func:`is_db_option_a`,
:func:`is_db_option_b`, :func:`is_gpt`, :func:`is_level_premium`,
:func:`is_single_premium`, :func:`is_target_premium`, :func:`is_annual_premium` and
:func:`is_monthly_premium`. Each reads its column from :func:`model_point`, and so does
each per-point join, so no projection cell compares text or calls a label accessor:
``IUL_US_S``'s label accessors, ``sex``, ``rate_class``, ``db_option``, ``qual_test``,
``premium_type``, ``premium_mode`` and ``surr_charge_id``, are kept as they are, for
reporting.

Ten names needed care.

**A withdrawal is not a claim.** The notes write the withdrawal outflow as its own term
of ``CF_t``, alongside the death and surrender legs, and the library follows that: the
payment is :func:`withdrawals`, published in a ``withdrawals`` column, and
``"WITHDRAWAL"`` is **not** a ``kind`` that :func:`claims` accepts -- it would otherwise
sit in the ``kind is None`` total and be double-counted against the standalone cells.
The per-policy amount is still ``claim_pp(t, "WITHDRAWAL")``, because that is
where the ``W_t - $25 fee`` rule lives and :func:`withdrawals` weights it by
:func:`pols_if`: a withdrawal is taken at BOM by policies still in force, not by a
decrement. Surrenders keep the ``"LAPSE"`` kind and are published as ``claims_lapse``,
so the column name matches the kind that produces it.

**The notes' month counts from issue; this model's counts from the valuation date.** The
notes' ``t`` and this model's are both 0-based and they coincide for a point issued at the
valuation date; for any other the notes' index is :func:`duration_mth`
``(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``.
Every ``mod 12`` test -- the anniversary premium, the anniversary loan -- is therefore
written against ``duration_mth(t)`` rather than ``t``, a segment's creation is a policy
month, and the surrender charge run-off uses ``duration_mth(t) + 1`` because the notes'
schedule counts the current month.

**A segment's slot is not its creation month.** ``seg_bal_pp(t, m)`` and the
segment cells beside it are keyed by ``m``, the policy month the segment was born in, as
in ``IUL_US_S``; the ladder's ``slot`` is the months since that birth at the valuation
date, ``k = duration_mth_init() - m``, which is what an extract of a policy's live
segments knows, and what one row of ``inforce_segments_sec.csv`` is keyed by. The two
meet only at ``t = 0``.

**The notes' cash surrender value is the net one.** Their ``CSV_t`` is :func:`ncsv_pp`,
not :func:`csv_pp`: the notes define ``CSV_t = AV_t - SC_t - L_t``, with the loan already
netted. The chassis and
``CashValue_SE`` split that into :func:`csv_pp` (``AV - SC``) and :func:`ncsv_pp`
(``CSV - L``). The chassis names are kept, and the notes' symbol maps to the second.

**The withdrawal fee is inside the withdrawal, not on top of it.** These notes say
``W_t`` is "gross of $25 fee" and that the "withdrawal outflow = W_t - $25 fee". The
account is therefore debited ``W_t``, the policyholder receives ``W_t - 25`` and the
insurer keeps the fee. The universal life chassis reads its own notes the other way --
there the fee is charged *on top* of the withdrawal -- so :func:`av_pp_at` deliberately
differs from the chassis at ``"BEF_FEE"``. A planned withdrawal above 0 and below the fee
would debit the account less than the fee it is charged, which :func:`proj_len` refuses.

**The death claim nets the loan at the end of the month.** These notes write
``death claim outflow = DB_t - L_t``; decrements are end-of-month events, after the
loan has accrued, so :func:`claim_pp` uses :func:`loan_bal_pp` at ``t``. The chassis
uses the opening balance because its own notes write ``L(t-1)``.

**The maintenance fee is income, the expenses outgo.** As on the chassis,
:func:`maint_fee_pp` is the non-COI part of the monthly deduction -- a charge *against
the account value* -- while :func:`expenses` is the insurer's own $75 a year plus $150
at issue **[std]**. Confusing them double-counts.

**The two cumulative premium accumulators are different.** :func:`cum_prem_net_pp` is
the notes' ``CumP_t``, premiums less withdrawals **and loans**, which is what the
no-lapse test compares against ``CumMNLP_t``. :func:`cum_prem_pp` is premiums less
withdrawals only, which is the base of the guideline premium and 7-pay tests. Using one
for the other quietly changes both answers, and so does opening either at 0 on a point in
force: each opens from a column of its own, :func:`cum_prem_init` and
:func:`cum_prem_net_init`.

**The MEC flag latches here, and does not in the S model.** ``IUL_US_S``'s flag is the
in-year 7-pay test alone, which stops applying in policy year 8 and so switches the flag
off exactly when the failure becomes permanent. This model latches it, as ``UL_US_S``
does, from :func:`is_mec_init` on a point in force: under IRC 7702A a contract that fails
the test is a modified endowment contract for good [R5].

**The fixed account and the collateral are not the account value less the loan.**
``IUL_US_S`` opens an in-force point with everything in the fixed account and the
collateral equal to the loan. Both part from those after the first loan: the collateral
is credited at :func:`loan_credit_rate_ann` while the loan accrues at ``loan_rate_ann``,
and the segments hold the rest of the account value. So each opens from its own column,
:func:`fa_pp_init` and :func:`lca_pp_init`, and the segments from the ladder; ``Data``
holds the account value to the sum of the three parts.
