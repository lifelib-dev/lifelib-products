"""The by-contract projection of :mod:`~.VA_US_SEC`.

The Space is parameterized by ``point_id``, so ``Projection[1]`` is an ItemSpace
projecting model point 1, the worked example's anchor cell issued at the valuation date::

    >>> Projection[1].result_cf()          # one row per month from the valuation date
    >>> Projection.point_id = 2            # or switch the default

Switch the default, as any Reference, before the model computes anything.

This is :mod:`~.VA_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``. A formula of
:mod:`~.VA_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on where the projection starts, where it
must answer for a month outside cover, where it read a scenario or a contractual event
at the wrong clock, where it compared a model point's text, or where its recursion ran
two cells a month; every other is :mod:`~.VA_US_S`'s own.
``products/variable_annuity/model-sec.md`` lists the rewritten cells with the reason for
each.

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent directory,
``products/variable_annuity/``, read at run time rather than stored inside the model.
The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas — no ``_data/``, no IOSpec, no
embedded values — so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an input can be
edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows ``annuallife.TradLife_A``;
contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs *inside* the model through
modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``VA_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and then
fails on first evaluation.

The readers and the filename References live on the sibling :mod:`~.VA_US_SEC.Data`
Space, reached here through the ``data`` Reference, so each file is read once per model
rather than once per model point. Five assumption tables are the files
:mod:`~.VA_US_S` reads, read in place; the model point table and the two scenarios are
this model's own, generated from :mod:`~.VA_US_S` and its inputs. The projection reads
each table as ``Data`` returns it checked, its keys read by value, and through cells of
its own, three for the fund table, two for the programme and one for each other table:

:func:`gawa_pct_at_age`, :func:`surr_charge_rate_at`, and :func:`prem_scheduled_pm` with
:func:`wd_scheduled_pm` are those cells, in that order, and :func:`sa_pp_init` reads the
subaccount values the model point table carries, through ``data.fund_values_init()``. The
first takes no key, and every accessor of the point reads it; :func:`sub_ids` takes none
either; each of the others is keyed by an age, a subaccount, a month, a count of years or
a policy month, and called by a monthly cell in cover only. The mortality, the fund set,
the two scenarios, the grid, the withdrawal charge schedule and the programme are joined
on a text key, the model point's ``sex``, ``fund_set``, ``scenario_id``, ``glwb_option``,
``cdsc_schedule`` or ``txn_id``, each inside the cells that read its table, and Phase 2
re-keys them.

.. rubric:: Projection basis

Monthly steps on two clocks. ``t`` counts months from the **valuation date**, 0-based,
the clock ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` runs on: ``t = 0`` is the valuation month for every
model point, however old the contract, month ``t`` runs from time ``t`` to time
``t + 1``, and the frame is ``t = 0 .. proj_len() - 1``, where :func:`proj_len` counts
the months from the valuation date to the end of cover,
``maturity_mth() - duration_mth_init()``. Row ``t`` is the same month for every point,
so the frames of a block line up and sum row by row. :mod:`~.VA_US_S` counts ``t`` the
same way, from the first month it projects, and enters its in-force point 2 at ``t = 0``
26 months after issue; but it opens every recursion and keys its issue events at
``t == 0``. Here the frame has an edge at each end: a policy issued at or after the
valuation date pays its single premium, and bears its acquisition expense, in its issue
month, :func:`t_entry`, the month with ``duration_mth(t) = 0``, where every recursion
opens; a policy in force at the valuation date opens at ``t = 0`` on the state its model
point carries; and cover ends with the last month before attained age ``omega_age``.

The *policy* month is ``duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``, the number of policy
months already **elapsed** at the start of month ``t``: 0 in a contract's issue month,
``duration_mth_init()`` at ``t = 0`` on a contract in force at the valuation date — the
worked example's carried state is one, in force with 26 elapsed months — and negative
before issue on a contract issued later. The ordinal policy month — the notes' "the
27th policy month" — is ``duration_mth(t) + 1``. Every calendar test (Contract
Anniversary, Contract Quarterly Anniversary, contract year, attained age) is written on
``duration_mth(t)``, never on ``t``.

``policy_year(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12 + 1`` is the contract year ``y``, a 1-based
contractual label, and ``contract_quarter(t) = duration_mth(t) // 3 + 1`` the contract
quarter ``k``. Contract Anniversaries fall at the **end** of the months where
``duration_mth + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 12)`` and Contract Quarterly Anniversaries at the end of
those where ``duration_mth + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)`` **[std]**; on a cell issued at the valuation
date that is ``t = 11, 23, 35, …`` and ``t = 2, 5, 8, …``. The attained age is
``a(t) = x + y − 1``, equivalently ``x + duration(t)`` with
``duration(t) = duration_mth(t) // 12``. Two months of the frame name the edges of a
contract year on the valuation clock: ``anniv_mth(t)``, the month at whose end the
anniversary closing the contract year of month ``t`` falls, and ``year_open_mth(t)``, the
month at whose end the year opened, which precedes the valuation date for the year under
way at ``t = 0`` on a contract valued in force mid-year.

The scenario inputs read the valuation clock. The gross fund returns, the VIX-squared
averages and the CMT rate are a market path in calendar time, shared by every point of a
block, so the ``t`` of *return_scenario_sec.csv* and *rate_scenario_sec.csv* is a
valuation month, and :func:`inv_return_mth` and :func:`scenario_rate` read them at ``t``
itself; each row of the model point table reads its own copy of :mod:`~.VA_US_S`'s path,
re-based to its months in force (``Data.return_scenario``). Expense inflation counts the
years from the valuation date, ``t // 12``, so maintenance expense is in valuation-date
dollars for every point alike (:func:`inflation_factor`). The transaction programmes, the
GAWA% grid, the withdrawal charge scale and the mortality stay on the policy clock, read
at the policy month, the attained age or the contract years completed. On a point issued
at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide, and the model computes what :mod:`~.VA_US_S`
computes.

Within a month the technical notes' processing order is followed exactly. At the
beginning of the month (BOM): if the contract is already depleted, run the
post-depletion routine and skip everything else; otherwise take the premium, which buys
units at the prior unit value per ``alloc[i]`` and raises ``GWB``, ``BB``, ``NP``,
``RP``, ``RB``, ``GAWA`` and ``ADJ``; then take the withdrawal, which fixes the GAWA% if
it is the first one, splits into excess and non-excess portions, computes the withdrawal
charge, cancels units pro rata and updates ``GWB``, ``GAWA`` and ``BB``. Then unit values
grow over the month. At the end of the month (EOM): the two rider fees are assessed at a
Contract Quarterly Anniversary and the annual contract fee at a Contract Anniversary,
both by pro-rata unit cancellation; then, at a Contract Anniversary only, the seven
guarantee events in the notes' order — GMDB withdrawal adjustment, GMDB roll-up, GLWB
bonus, step-up, GWB Adjustment Date test, the non-For-Life ``GAWA = GWB`` floor, and the
$10,000,000 cap; then the depletion test; then decrements, **death first, then
surrender** **[std]**.

Outside cover, before issue and from :func:`proj_len` on, every count, cash flow, balance
and rate is 0.0 and every flag ``False``; the four factors that multiply a base or a rate,
:func:`gmdb_wd_factor`, :func:`gmdb_factor_acc`, :func:`lapse_dyn_mult` and
:func:`lapse_wd_factor`, are 1.0, no change; :func:`bonus_end` is 0; and the phase is
``PRE_ISSUE`` before issue and ``EXPIRED`` from the end of cover. The clocks,
:func:`duration_mth` among them, and :func:`inflation_factor` keep their values.
:func:`is_active` is the test, made before any table or rate is read. One read reaches
ahead of the month:
:func:`lapse_wd_factor` asks whether the contract year of month ``t`` takes a withdrawal,
and reads it once, at :func:`anniv_mth`, up to 11 months later and inside the frame,
since the answer is a property of the contract year that depends on no count and on
nothing after that anniversary.

**Undiscounted.** Like every model in this library, this one projects *gross liability
cash flows* only. Reserves and discounting are a separate layer: the notes' *Valuation
and reserve pointers* section cites VM-21's CTE70 stochastic reserve, C-3 Phase II's
CTE(98), VM-22/VM-V §1 for the post-depletion stream and IRC §807, rather than
reproducing any of them.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cells names follow lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` and ``savings.CashValue_SE``
wherever those models have an analogue, and :mod:`.MYGA_US_S` — the deferred
annuity chassis of this library — wherever the two products share a concept:
``pols_*`` for policy counts, ``av_*`` for account values, plural nouns for cash flows,
``*_rate`` for rates, ``*_pp`` for per-contract amounts, ``*_at(t, timing)`` for a
quantity read at a point inside the month. What running in force adds is named as
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` names it: ``duration_mth`` read from the model point,
``policy_count``, ``pols_new_biz``, ``pols_if_at`` with its ``"BEF_NB"`` timing,
``is_active`` and ``result_pols``; ``t_entry`` and ``maturity_mth`` are
:mod:`.MYGA_US_SEC`'s, and ``anniv_mth`` and ``year_open_mth`` :mod:`.FIA_US_SEC`'s. A
column of the opening state is the cell it opens with ``_init`` added, ``gwb_pp_init``
for :func:`gwb_pp`; a value of the contract year to date adds ``_ytd_init``, and a
balance at the anniversary that opened the year under way ``_prev_anniv_init``. A reader
keyed by an age, a year count or a policy month is ``<cell>_at`` or ``<cell>_pm``. The
``is_*`` cells decode the model point's four switch columns, once a point, into the flags
the projection branches on, so that no monthly cell compares a column's text and none
calls a label accessor (``stepup_basis``, ``gmdb_option``, ``scenario_id``, ...), which is
left to reporting. The text a monthly cell still compares is :mod:`~.VA_US_S`'s timing
and kind strings, which Phase 2 turns into int codes, and the join keys each table is read
on, inside the cells that read it. The technical notes use compact actuarial symbols
instead. The notes' month index is this model's ``duration_mth(t)``, so the notes' ``t``
in the left-hand column is ``duration_mth(t)`` throughout. The mapping is:

============================  ==============================  ==============================

Model point attributes the notes and the model name identically — ``sex``,
``designated_lives``, ``tax_status``, ``premium_tax_rate``, ``glwb_option``,
``gmdb_option``, ``cdsc_schedule`` and the ``rate_sheet_date`` Reference — are not
repeated in the table above; ``issue_date`` is not carried at all, the model working in
policy months throughout.

Nine names needed care.

``pols_if(t)`` is the count in force at the **start** of month ``t`` — the notes'
``l(t-1)`` — and is the weight applied to that same row's cash flows, so
``premiums(t) / premium_pp(t)`` is exactly ``pols_if(t)`` and the printed in-force column
reconciles with the row it sits on. That is the library-wide convention, set by
:mod:`.Term_US_S` and by ``savings.CashValue_SE``. The notes' own end-of-month ``l(t)``
has not gone anywhere: it is ``pols_if_at(t, "AFT_DECR")``, and the roll-forward
is written across it.

``lapse_rate(t)`` is the **annual** total surrender rate and :func:`lapse_rate_mth` the
monthly one, matching the ``mort_rate`` / ``mort_rate_mth`` pair. Both spellings of the
notes' ``q^w`` are present and the suffix is the only thing that tells them apart, so
read the suffix.

``wd_free_pp(t)`` is the portion of a withdrawal covered by the **free-withdrawal
allowance**, which is what the same name means on the deferred annuity chassis
(:mod:`.MYGA_US_S`, ``min(W, FW)``). On this product a second exemption
stacks on top of it — no CDSC applies to cumulative withdrawals within ``L`` [S1] — and
the union of the two is :func:`wd_exempt_pp`, the portion of ``W(t)`` bearing no charge
at all. The two differ by exactly :func:`wd_nonexcess_pp`, and it is
:func:`wd_exempt_pp`, not :func:`wd_free_pp`, that complements
:func:`wd_chargeable_pp`. The year-to-date cumulative is
:func:`free_wd_used_cum_pp`, named for what it is rather than sharing the ``wd_*`` stem.

``E(t)`` is the **guarantee** excess here — the portion of a withdrawal above the GLWB
annual limit — and :func:`wd_excess_pp` carries that meaning. In
:mod:`.MYGA_US_S` the same cells name means the portion of a withdrawal above
the free allowance, i.e. the *charge* base. On this product those are two different
quantities and both exist: the charge base is :func:`wd_chargeable_pp`. Reading
``wd_excess_pp`` across the two models without checking is the single easiest mistake to
make in this library.

``E(t)`` in :mod:`.Term_US_S` is expenses, which here is :func:`expenses` as usual. ``M``
is the in-the-moneyness ratio here and the market value adjustment in
:mod:`.MYGA_US_S`; a VA separate account has no MVA at all, so there is no
collision in the model, only in the reader's memory. ``c(t)`` is the CDSC here and the
Model #805 contract charge in :mod:`.MYGA_US_S`; it becomes
:func:`wd_charge_pp`. ``g`` is the GAWA% here and the monthly nonforfeiture factor there;
it becomes :func:`gawa_pct_at_age`. And ``b`` is the GLWB bonus percentage here and the
MVA distribution yield there.

Two cells the chassis has that this model deliberately does **not**: ``mgsv_pp`` and
``surr_value_pp``. NAIC Model #805 expressly excludes variable annuities and reaches a VA
only through its *fixed* account under Model #250 §7.B [REG-R42][REG-R43], and this
contract has no fixed account because electing the Roll-up GMDB removes the Fixed Account
Options [S1]. There is therefore no minimum guaranteed surrender value and no pre-floor
surrender value to distinguish: :func:`surr_benefit_pp` is simply ``AV(t)`` less the
CDSC. Carrying the chassis' floor across would be the error the chassis file itself warns
against.

.. rubric:: The unit ledger

The notes write the account value as ``AV = Σ_i U_i V_i`` and require charges assessed
*per unit of value* (fund expense, M&E, administrative asset charge) to live **inside**
``V_i``, while charges assessed *per contract or on a benefit base* (the annual contract
fee, the two rider fees) are collected by **cancelling units**, leaving ``V_i``
untouched: ``ΔU_i = C · w_i(t) / V_i(t)``, so ``ΔAV = C``.

.. rubric:: State carried into the frame

Every state variable in this model is a **closing balance of month t**: ``av_pp(t)``,
``sa_pp(t, i)``, ``gwb_pp(t)``, ``bb_pp(t)``, ``rb_pp(t)``, ``gawa_pp(t)``, ``np_pp(t)``,
``rp_pp(t)`` and ``adj_pp(t)`` are all values at the **end** of month ``t``. Their
*opening* value is therefore ``S(t - 1)``, and in the first month a contract is on the
books, :func:`t_entry`, it is the model point's ``S_init()`` instead, its column of the
opening state: every recursion reads its previous month first,
``S(t - 1) if t > t_entry() else S_init()``, then the month's own steps, as
:mod:`.MYGA_US_SEC` and :mod:`.FIA_US_SEC` write it. That single convention replaces an
entry-instant row: the premium, the guarantee-base initialization and the acquisition
expense are all beginning-of-month flows of the issue month, where the opening state is
0, and the issue values come by :mod:`~.VA_US_S`'s own rules there. **No carried-in state
is read before the first month on the books**, and no cell in cover reads a month before
:func:`t_entry`.

A contract in force at the valuation date carries twenty columns of opening state, per
contract, as it stands at the start of month 0, before any month-0 event, each exactly
what :mod:`~.VA_US_S` carries into that month: the two subaccount values, which
:mod:`~.VA_US_S` would split from the account value by the target allocation, wrong once
the funds drift apart; the GWB, the Bonus Base, the GAWA, the GMDB Benefit Base, the
cumulative Net Premiums, the Remaining Premium and the GWB Adjustment; the locked GAWA%,
the end of the Bonus Period and whether a withdrawal has been taken. Four quantities of
the contract year restart at its start — the withdrawals to date, the free allowance
they used, the GMDB's dollar-for-dollar reduction and its proportional factor — and the
year under way at the valuation date opened before it on a contract valued mid-year, so
each opens at ``t = 0`` on its ``_ytd_init`` column, as does whether that year has taken
a withdrawal, :func:`wd_this_year_init`. The Benefit Base at the anniversary that opened
the year is read three ways (:func:`rb_prior_anniv_pp`): from the frame where that
anniversary is on the books, from :func:`rb_pp_prev_anniv_init` where it precedes the
valuation date, and by the issue rule in a contract's first year. The highest quarterly
account value of the year before the valuation month and the VIX-formula rate of the last
quarter to end before it are columns too, :func:`stepup_base_pp_ytd_init` and
:func:`phi_glwb_init`. The depleted status takes none: a contract in force enters month 0
depleted exactly where its opening account value is at or below
``av_depletion_threshold``, and new business never does (:func:`depleted_open`).

The model carries the *product* ``SA_i = U_i V_i`` rather than the two factors, because
with no transfers between subaccounts the two are never needed apart, and every quantity
the notes print is a subaccount **value**. The distinction the ledger exists to enforce
survives intact: a per-unit charge multiplies ``sa_pp`` through :func:`unit_growth`,
while a unit cancellation multiplies it by ``(1 − C / AV)`` — which is exactly pro-rata
deduction, and which therefore leaves every ``w_i`` unchanged.

That property is necessary for the notes' 60/40 anchor cell to still sit at exactly
60/40 twenty-six months later, but it is **not sufficient**, and it would be a bad
lesson to take away on its own: unequal growth moves the weights whatever the charges
do. What closes the gap is the illustrative ``base`` path, reverse-engineered so that
the two subaccounts grow at the same rate *net of fund expense* (see the ``provenance``
column of *return_scenario.csv*) — with equal net growth and pro-rata cancellation the
weights cannot move at all. The worked-example month itself is the counter-example:
``r_1`` = +1.20% against ``r_2`` = −0.30% takes ``w_1`` from 0.600000 at the beginning of
that month to :func:`sa_weight` = 0.603519 by the time the fees are read at its end. On
the cell issued at the valuation date the month is ``t = 26`` — the 27th policy month —
and on the carried state in force at 26 months it is ``t = 0``.

.. rubric:: Timing arguments

Account and subaccount values, following ``CashValue_SE``'s ``av_pp_at``:

``"BEF_PREM"``
    ``AV(t-1)``, at the start of month ``t`` before the premium — the opening balance,
    and in the first month on the books, :func:`t_entry`, the model point's opening
    state, :func:`sa_pp_init` and :func:`av_pp_init`, which are 0 on new business.
``"BEF_WD"``
    after the premium has bought units, before the withdrawal.
``"BEF_INV"``
    ``AV'(t)``, after the withdrawal, before unit value growth.
``"BEF_FEE"``
    after growth, before the rider fees and the contract fee. This is the point at which
    the notes read the pro-rata key ``w_i``.
``"EOM"``
    ``AV(t)``, after every charge. Equal to :func:`av_pp`.

Guarantee bases (``gwb_pp_at``, ``gawa_pp_at``, ``rb_pp_at``) take ``"BEF_PREM"``,
``"BEF_WD"`` and ``"BEF_ANNIV"``; their end-of-month value, after the anniversary
guarantee events, is the plain cells (:func:`gwb_pp`, :func:`gawa_pp`, :func:`rb_pp`).
``"BEF_PREM"`` opens on the model point's ``_init`` column at :func:`t_entry`.

Policy counts, following ``CashValue_SE``'s ``pols_if_at`` and
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``:

``"BEF_NB"``
    the count carried in from month ``t - 1``, before month ``t``'s new business:
    :func:`pols_if_init` at :func:`t_entry`, the contracts in force at the valuation
    date, 0 on new business.
``"BEF_DECR"``
    ``l(t-1)``, in force at the start of month ``t``: ``"BEF_NB"`` plus that month's
    :func:`pols_new_biz`. Equal to ``pols_if(t)``.
``"BEF_LAPSE"``
    after deaths, ``l(t-1)(1 - q^d(t))``.
``"AFT_DECR"``
    after surrenders, ``l(t)`` — the notes' end-of-month count, and equal to
    ``pols_if_at(t + 1, "BEF_NB")`` except in the last covered month, where the survivors
    leave as :func:`pols_maturity` instead.

Benefit ``kind`` arguments are ``"DEATH"``, ``"LAPSE"`` and ``"MATURITY"``. Any other
value of any of these raises ``ValueError``.

.. rubric:: pols_maturity and the projection horizon

The technical notes state no projection horizon, and this contract does not supply one:
once the account value is exhausted the For Life Guarantee is a **pure life-contingent
annuity at GAWA**, which the notes rank sixth in their sensitivity list precisely because
the mortality basis then becomes the whole story. The model therefore runs to attained

lives with no cause. The identity is written on start-of-month counts because that is
what :func:`pols_if` carries: the next month opens on what is left, before its own new
business, and in the last covered month ``pols_if_at(proj_len(), "BEF_NB")`` is zero,
every survivor of that month having left as :func:`pols_maturity`. The name follows

assumption.

      ``av_depletion_threshold``, a contract that has not withdrawn has no GAWA% locked:
      the percentage locks at the first withdrawal or at depletion, and before either the

      at, unless its grid gave 0% at an attained age it reached before the valuation
      month, ``Data.gawa_pct_zero_by_point()`` at the point, read here and nowhere else;
