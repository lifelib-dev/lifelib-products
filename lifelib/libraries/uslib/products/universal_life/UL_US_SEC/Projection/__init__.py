"""The by-policy monthly projection of the :mod:`~.UL_US_SEC` model.

The Space is parameterized by ``point_id``, so ``Projection[6]`` is an ItemSpace
projecting model point 6, ``UL_US_S``'s in-force point restated six months on, in force
126 months at the valuation date with its loan::

    >>> Projection[6].result_cf()          # one row per month from the valuation date
    >>> Projection[6].result_av()          # the account value roll-forward behind it
    >>> Projection.point_id = 2            # or switch the default

Switch the default, as any Reference, before the model computes anything.

This is :mod:`~.UL_US_S` taught to run in force at a valuation date, as lifelib's
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` extends ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``. A formula of
:mod:`~.UL_US_S` is rewritten where it depends on where the projection starts, where it
must answer for a month outside cover, or where it reads a table at a policy year or an
attained age; every other is :mod:`~.UL_US_S`'s own.
``products/universal_life/model-sec.md`` lists the rewritten cells with the reason for
each.

.. rubric:: Input data

Inputs are **external files**: plain CSVs living in the model folder's parent
directory, ``products/universal_life/``, read at run time rather than stored inside
the model. The model folder therefore holds nothing but formulas -- no ``_data/``, no
IOSpec, no embedded values -- so a diff of the model shows logic changes only, and an
input can be edited or swapped without rewriting the model. This follows
``annuallife.TradLife_A``; contrast ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S``, which keeps its inputs
*inside* the model through modelx's IOSpec machinery.

The consequence worth knowing: **the model is not portable on its own.** Copying the
``UL_US_SEC`` folder without its parent's CSVs produces a model that reads and
then fails on first evaluation.

The readers live in the unparameterized :mod:`~.UL_US_SEC.Data` Space, reached
here through the ``data`` Reference, so each file is read once per model rather than
once per model point. The seven assumption tables are the files :mod:`~.UL_US_S` reads,
read in place; the model point table is this model's own:

.. rubric:: Two clocks

``t`` counts months from the **valuation date**, 0-based, the clock
``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` runs on: ``t = 0`` is the valuation month for every model
point, however old the policy, month ``t`` runs from the monthiversary at time ``t`` to
the next, and the frame is ``t = 0, 1, ..., proj_len() - 1``, where :func:`proj_len`
counts the months from the valuation date to the end of the projection. Row ``t`` is the
same month for every point, so the frames of a block line up and sum row by row.

``duration_mth(t)`` counts **policy months**, the months the policy has been in force at
time ``t``: ``duration_mth(t) = duration_mth_init() + t``, where :func:`duration_mth_init`
is read from the model point -- positive for a policy in force at the valuation date, in
any month of its policy year, 0 for one issued at it, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months
later, at most ten years later. It is the notes' ``d(t)``, and everything contractual
reads it: the surrender charge run-off, the COI, per-unit and premium persistency scales
by policy year, the corridor factor and the mortality rate by attained age, the first
withdrawal year, and the GPT and 7-pay limits. The policy year is the 1-based contractual
label ``policy_year(t) = duration(t) + 1`` and the attained age (ANB) is
``age(t) = age_at_entry() + duration(t)``, both derived and never indexed by. Point 3,
``UL_US_S``'s in-force cell, is in policy year 11 at attained age 45 at ``t = 0``, and
point 9, to be issued 25 months after the valuation date, is issued at ``t = 25``.

``UL_US_S`` already counts its months from the start of its own projection rather than
from issue, and opens its in-force point 3 there with its account value and its loan.
What the valuation clock adds is that ``t = 0`` is one instant for every point, that a
point may be issued after it, and that a point in force brings in what its past has left
it: the face its withdrawals have left, the year's free allowance it has used, the
premiums it has paid and its MEC latch, four more opening values than ``UL_US_S`` reads.

The economic inputs read the valuation clock: the declared rates,
:func:`crediting_rate_ann` and :func:`comp_rate_ann`, flat as shipped, and expense
inflation, ``inflation_factor(t) = (1 + inflation_rate)^(t // 12)``, ``UL_US_S``'s step
by year moved onto ``t``, so that the maintenance expense is in valuation-date dollars for
every point alike. Acquisition is charged per policy issued, in the issue month, and is
not inflated, as in ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``.

On a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and this model computes what
:mod:`~.UL_US_S` computes: every cell the two share agrees at every argument
:mod:`~.UL_US_S` evaluates in its sweep, but for three whose meaning changed,
``pols_if_init``, now the count already in force at the valuation date, ``model_point``,
a row of another table, and ``result_pols``, which gains the month's new business. That
is how :mod:`~.UL_US_S`'s goldens on its new-business points carry over, the worked
example among them, and ``tests/test_model_conventions.py`` asserts it cell by cell. On
point 3 the projection is :mod:`~.UL_US_S`'s, month for month, its expenses apart, which
are in valuation-date dollars.

The **value** state variables are closing balances at the end of month ``t``:
``av_pp(t)``, ``loan_bal_pp(t)`` and ``cum_prem_pp(t)``. ``sum_assured_at(t)`` is not a
closing balance: it is the face amount in force **during** month ``t``, after that
month's BOM withdrawal reduction -- the face that ``db_pp(t)``, ``net_amt_at_risk(t)``
and ``units(t)`` are measured on. ``wd_used_year(t)`` is the free allowance used in the
policy year before month ``t``'s withdrawal, and ``is_mec(t)`` the 7-pay latch after
month ``t``'s test. The opening values -- the notes' ``AV(t-1)``, ``L(t-1)``,
``CumPrem(t-1)`` -- are ``av_pp_at(t, "BEF_PREM")``, ``loan_bal_pp_bom(t)`` and
``cum_prem_pp(t - 1)``, and at :func:`t_entry`, the first month on the books, each chain
opens from the model point's opening state instead, so that nothing is ever asked for a
month before the valuation date or before issue. For a point in force the opening state
is six columns of its row, per policy, as the policy stands at the start of month 0,
before any month-0 event: the account value and the loan, ``UL_US_S``'s own columns
(:func:`av_pp_init`, :func:`loan_bal_init`); the face in force
(:func:`sum_assured_init`); the free withdrawal allowance already used in the policy year
under way (:func:`wd_used_year_init`); the premiums less withdrawals paid to date
(:func:`cum_prem_init`); and the MEC latch (:func:`is_mec_init`). ``UL_US_S`` takes the
last four as they stand at issue, the face at issue and nothing used, paid or failed, on
its in-force point too. For a point issued at or after the valuation date every one of
them is 0, and the issue values come from the formulas: :func:`sum_assured` for the face,
0 for the rest.

Every chain is one cell a month. ``av_pp_at(t, "BEF_PREM")`` forms the previous month's
close itself, from its own value at ``t - 1`` and month ``t - 1``'s net premium,
withdrawal, fee, deduction and interest, the same sum in the same order as
``av_pp(t - 1)``, rather than calling for it, where ``UL_US_S``'s account value chain ran
through five cells a month; :func:`loan_bal_pp_bom` does the same for the loan, where
``UL_US_S``'s ran through two, and the ``"BEF_NB"`` timing of :func:`pols_if_at` for the
count, one cell a month as ``UL_US_S``'s :func:`pols_if` already was. The face, the year's
withdrawal usage and the cumulative premium call themselves at ``t - 1`` before anything
else, and the MEC latch does once its in-year test has run. A compiled model runs these
chains on the C stack.

Within each month the notes' monthiversary order is followed exactly:

1. amortize the surrender charge (:func:`surr_charge_rate`);
2. gross premium and its load, net premium to the account value
   (:func:`premium_pp`, :func:`prem_to_av_pp`);
3. withdrawal and withdrawal fee, and under Option A the face reduction they force
   (:func:`wd_pp`, :func:`wd_fee_pp`, :func:`sum_assured_at`) -- after which the
   account value is the notes' ``AV'(t)``, :func:`av_pp_at(t, "BEF_FEE")<av_pp_at>`;
4. death benefit and the GPT corridor test (:func:`db_pp`);
5. net amount at risk, the death benefit discounted one month at the **guaranteed**
   rate less the account value measured **before** the deduction
   (:func:`net_amt_at_risk`);
6. the monthly deduction (:func:`mth_deduction_pp`);
7. the shortfall test (:func:`is_shortfall`);
8. end of month: one month's interest on the post-deduction balance
   (:func:`inv_income_pp`) and loan interest accrual (:func:`loan_bal_pp`);
9. end of month: decrements, death before lapse (:func:`pols_death`,
   :func:`pols_lapse`).

Cash flows are **undiscounted**. Premiums, expenses and premium taxes fall at BOM and
are weighted by ``pols_if(t)``; death claims by ``pols_if(t) * mort_rate_mth(t)``;
surrender payments by ``pols_if(t) * (1 - mort_rate_mth(t)) * lapse_rate_mth(t)``.
Partial withdrawals also fall at BOM and are weighted by ``pols_if(t)``, but they are
:func:`withdrawals`, a cash flow line of their own rather than a ``kind`` of
:func:`claims`.

.. rubric:: Counts

``pols_if(t)`` is the count that weights row ``t``: ``pols_if_at(t, "BEF_DECR")``, the
count carried in from ``t - 1`` (``"BEF_NB"``) plus the month's new business,
:func:`pols_new_biz`, before the month's decrements. A point in force at the valuation
date opens with :func:`pols_if_init`, its ``policy_count``; one issued at or after the
valuation date opens with none, and takes its ``policy_count`` as new business in its
issue month. The recursion's base is :func:`t_entry`, and before issue
(:func:`is_active`) every count, and so every cash flow, is zero, and so is every value
state. ``UL_US_S`` already names three timings, in a cell that returns ``pols_if(t)`` for
each and that nothing calls. ``"BEF_DECR"`` keeps that meaning, and so does ``"BEF_MAT"``,
the count before any maturity, since nothing matures: the name keeps its S model's
meaning, as in the family's other models, and ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s start-of-month
``"BEF_MAT"`` is not adopted. ``"BEF_NB"`` is the one timing this model gives a new
meaning, ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE``'s, and it differs from ``UL_US_S``'s only in the issue
month, where it counts the issued policies as new business, not yet in. Inside the month
the decrements are :mod:`~.UL_US_S`'s, death before lapse.

.. rubric:: The end of the projection

The frame ends at :func:`omega_mth`, where the mortality table ends, and not at an event
of the contract, which never matures. With the shipped table -- an annual rate of 1.0 at
ages 119 and 120 -- and a class factor and an A/E of 1 or more, every life has died by
the end of the first month at attained age 119. With a preferred class, an A/E below 1,
or a table that stays below 1, lives survive the last month, and the roll-forwards read
them: :func:`check_av_roll_fwd` and :func:`av_change` read the opening account value in
force of month ``t + 1``, which in the last month is ``t = proj_len()``. So the two
opening values they read there, the count (the ``"BEF_NB"`` timing of
:func:`pols_if_at`, and through it :func:`pols_if`) and the account value
(``av_pp_at(t, "BEF_PREM")``), are defined for ``0 <= duration_mth(t) <= omega_mth()``:
on the books, and in the month after the frame, where they are the survivors of the last
month and the account value they carry. Both equal :mod:`~.UL_US_S`'s values there
exactly. Every other cell is zero or false there, as before issue: the account value
inside the month, the loan, every charge, premium, withdrawal, decrement rate, decrement,
claim and flow, and the expenses, whose maintenance would otherwise fall on the carried
count; only the two clocks, the inputs read on the valuation clock and the lapse shock's
neutral 1.0 hold values there.
And nothing reads past ``t = proj_len()``: :func:`av_change` and the two checks' residual
cells, which read ``t + 1``, are zero outside cover before they read it.

.. rubric:: Naming

Cells names follow lifelib's ``basiclife.BasicTerm_S`` and ``savings.CashValue_SE``
wherever those models have an analogue -- ``pols_*`` for policy counts, ``av_*`` for
account values, plural nouns for cash flows, ``*_rate`` for rates, ``*_pp`` for
per-policy amounts, ``timing`` and ``kind`` string arguments. What running in force adds
is named as ``basiclife.BasicTerm_SE`` names it: ``duration_mth`` read from the model
point, ``policy_count``, ``pols_new_biz``, ``pols_if_at`` with its ``"BEF_NB"`` timing,
``is_active`` and ``result_pols``. ``t_entry``, the first month on the books, is the SEC
models' own, and ``omega_mth`` this model's, named for ``omega_age``, where the
projection ends, since the contract has no end of its own. A column of the opening state
is the cell it opens with ``_init`` added, in ``UL_US_S``'s spelling of the stem:
``av_pp_init`` and ``loan_bal_init`` are ``UL_US_S``'s own, ``sum_assured_init``,
``wd_used_year_init`` and ``is_mec_init`` are new, and ``cum_prem_init`` is
``ULSG_US_S``'s name for the same column. ``wd_used_year`` already says it restarts each
policy year, so its column takes no ``_ytd``. A table read at a policy year has one
reader keyed by the year, ``<cell>_py(y)``, and a table read at an attained age one keyed
by the age, ``<cell>_at(a)``; the monthly cell keeps ``UL_US_S``'s name and calls it
inside cover. The surrender-charge schedule, keyed by its ID, has one reader for each of
its two columns, :func:`surr_charge_rate_max` and :func:`surr_charge_runoff_years`. A
check's residual in month t is ``<check>_resid(t)``. A text column a monthly cell
branches on is read through bool decodes, one for each value it branches on, named for
the value:
:func:`is_db_option_a` and :func:`is_db_option_b`, :func:`is_gpt`, and
:func:`is_level_premium`, :func:`is_single_premium` and :func:`is_target_premium`. So no
monthly cell compares text, and ``UL_US_S``'s label accessors are kept as they are, for
reporting and for the per-point joins that key the class factor, the COI scale and the
surrender-charge schedule.

=========================  ==============================  ==========================

The table covers every symbol the notes define: the Model point attributes table, the
State variables table and the notation list, in that order, followed by the cash flow
rows; the cells running in force adds sit beside the symbols they open, key or count.
Three symbols have **no cells at all**, and are carried in the table as ``(not
modelled)`` so that the absence is recorded rather than silent: ``grace_flag(t)``, the
one of the notes' ten state variables with no counterpart here, because the grace
cascade is a diagnostic and no in-grace state is held (:func:`is_shortfall`);
``premium_mode``, because every premium in this model is monthly **[std]**; and
``earned_rate(t)``, the input the notes' optional NGE revision rule would need
(:func:`crediting_rate_ann`).

Eight names needed care.

The notes' ``risk_class`` is :func:`rate_class` here, and the model point table column
is ``rate_class`` too. The name is taken from ``Term_US_S``/``BasicTerm_S``, which
this library follows ahead of the notes wherever the two collide; ``rate_class`` also
avoids reading as Python's ``class``. The six classes themselves are the product
spec's, unchanged.

``l(t)`` in the notes is the in-force probability at the **start** of month ``t``, before
that month's decrements, with ``l(0) = 1``; ``pols_if(t)`` is the same quantity under
``BasicTerm_S``'s name, after the month's new business, so ``pols_if(t) = l(t)``. On a
point issued at ``t = 0``, ``pols_if(0)`` is the issued count, the notes' ``l(0)``, while
``pols_if_init()`` is 0, the count already in force at the valuation date; on a point in
force the two are one count. The notes' recursion ``l(t+1) = l(t)(1 - q_m(t))(1 - w_m(t))``
is the ``pols_if_at(t + 1, "BEF_NB")`` step. Every BOM cash flow is weighted by
``pols_if(t)``, which is the notes' own ``l(t)`` weighting; take care not to read ``l(t)``
as an end-of-month count, which would weight every flow by the survivors of the month's
own decrements.

The notes write the monthly deduction as ``MD(t)`` and split it into a per-policy
charge, a per-unit charge, rider charges and the COI charge. ``CashValue_SE`` calls the
non-COI part of an account-value deduction ``maint_fee``; that name is kept here for
:func:`maint_fee_pp`, and :func:`mth_deduction_pp` is the notes' ``MD(t)`` in full.
:func:`expenses` is something different -- the insurer's own **[std]** maintenance
expense of $75 per policy per year, a cash flow, not a charge against the account
value. The two must not be confused: ``maint_fee`` is income, ``expenses`` is outgo.

The surrender-charge run-off ``SC(t) = max(0, (9.00 - (d(t) + 1)/12) x U)`` counts the
**current** month: one twelfth of a year's amortization is already earned in the issue
month, so the charge is $8.916667 per $1,000 in the issue month, not $9.00. The month
count in :func:`surr_charge_rate` is therefore ``duration_mth(t) + 1``, not
``duration_mth(t)``; using the completed months alone shifts the whole run-off by a
month.

``q_coi`` is quoted per $1,000 of net amount at risk **per month** and ``e_unit`` per
$1,000 of face per month, so both are divided by 1,000 -- or multiplied by
:func:`units` -- before they meet a currency amount. :func:`coi_rate` is therefore not
comparable with ``CashValue_SE.coi_rate``, which is a rate per unit of account value.

``surr_charge_pp(t)`` is the surrender charge *scheduled* at month ``t``;
``surr_charge(t)`` is the amount actually *collected* from lapsing policies, which is
capped by the account value because :func:`csv_pp` is floored at zero. In the first
policy years the schedule exceeds the account value and the two differ by a lot.

The notes' cash flow table lists "Withdrawal outgo" beside "Death claims" and
"Surrender outgo", but a partial withdrawal is a payment made on the **owner's
election**, not on a contingency, so it is not a claim here: it is :func:`withdrawals`,
its own cash flow line and its own ``result_cf()`` column, and ``"WITHDRAWAL"`` is not
a ``kind`` of :func:`claims` or of :func:`claim_pp`. The consequence to hold on to is
that ``claims(t)`` with no ``kind`` is the death and surrender total *only*, so
:func:`net_cf` subtracts :func:`withdrawals` as a separate term. The per-policy amount
stays :func:`wd_pp`, which is the notes' ``W(t)``.

Finally, the notes write ``AV'(t)`` for one quantity and use it for two: the balance
the monthly deduction comes out of, and the balance the death benefit and the net
amount at risk are measured against. The two coincide until a policy in permanent
shortfall drives the account value negative -- which this model does not prevent,
because it does not terminate such a policy (:func:`is_shortfall`).
:func:`av_pp_at(t, "BEF_FEE")<av_pp_at>` is the first and stays signed;
:func:`av_pp_db_basis` is the second and is floored at zero **[std]**, so an Option B
death benefit can never fall below the face amount.
