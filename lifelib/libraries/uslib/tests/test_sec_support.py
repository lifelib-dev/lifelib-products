"""Tests of the SEC harness and row generator in :mod:`sec_support`, on ``Term_US_S``.

Phase 0 of USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md builds the SEC test machinery before any SEC model exists, so
it is tested here on what does exist.  ``Term_US_S`` is compared with a second read of
itself, where the twin identity must hold exactly and must break where a Reference is
changed.  Small synthetic models stand in where a difference of a given kind must be seen.
And a synthetic :class:`SecSpec`, never registered except under ``monkeypatch`` for the
regeneration round trip, generates a table from Term's two points.

What each test pins, against the plan (its §4 item 3 and §5.2):

* T1's comparison, :func:`twin_mismatches`: silent on a true twin, but only after it has
  compared every value the S sweep cached, a tuple argument included; loud, and specific,
  on a changed one; bounded by ``limit``; an SEC error, an uncomparable value or an S cell
  the SEC model lacks reported rather than raised or passed; S's reads past its own frame
  left out; an offset, or an argument map, turning S's call into SEC's; and, at stage
  ``"EC"``, :func:`codes` turning S's timing and phase strings into SEC's int References.
* T2 and T3's harness: :func:`temp_inputs` copies a product so an added point projects
  exactly as its source, and writes floats the models' reader reads back exactly;
  :func:`shift_months` re-bases a table under both readings; :func:`frame_mismatches`
  compares on an offset and refuses to pass a comparison that compares nothing, or less
  than the whole splice.
* T6's generator: :func:`build_sec_table` writes twins, a derived row and a future row
  with the right counts, durations, sources and ids, and no text that is not S's own or
  composed from S's keys and a month (``CLAUDE.md``); :func:`write_generated` is a no-op on
  a rerun; and :func:`check_generated` reports an edited S row cell by cell, but reads a
  float by its value, so a file written on another platform checks clean.
* C2's fingerprint: :func:`fingerprint_months` names the frame's first, last and quartile
  months; :func:`fingerprint_text` writes a literal that reads back as the freeze exactly,
  within 92 columns; and :func:`fingerprint_mismatches` reports every kind of departure,
  a spike in a month the freeze does not name and a zero column that moves included.
* Compiling: :func:`cython_missing` names what a machine lacks, and :func:`require_cython`
  skips, or fails under ``USLIB_REQUIRE_CYTHON=1``; :class:`SecBuilds` builds a model
  once and keeps a failed build's error for every asker; C3's readers find every kind of
  fault in written declarations, a written spec and written C; C5's static check finds
  every construct it forbids in a synthetic model and passes the ones it allows; C4's
  comparison keeps a value's kind and floors its tolerance at the magnitude, or at a
  tolerance of 0 tells one ulp apart; and :func:`full_sweep` reaches every cell at every
  month and keeps each raise.  None of these compiles anything.

modelx keeps every model in one registry, and ``conftest.term_life`` already holds the
default name, so every model here is read under a name of its own and closed.
