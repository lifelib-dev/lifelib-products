"""The conventions of stage "EC": what every SEC model that compiles must satisfy (Phase 2).

USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md's Phase 2 changes how each ``_SEC`` model is represented, and no number
it computes (D2), so that it compiles under modelx-cython into C-typed code, as
``basiclife/BasicTerm_SC`` does.  ``test_model_conventions.py`` holds what every model
satisfies at either stage.  This module holds what compiling adds, parametrized over the
SEC models registered at stage ``"EC"``, so that each product meets it from the commit that
moves it there, Term_US_SEC first (M14):

* C5, no Python machinery in ``Projection``: no pandas, no module, no text, no reporting
  cell, no generator or comprehension, no call but to a cell, a ``Data`` vector or a
  builtin Cython turns into C, no list, dict, set or tuple built, no keyword call that
  would keep a cell a Python method, and every ``Data`` vector a numeric array read by
  element.  Read from the formulas, so it runs in every suite, with or without a
  compiler.
* C3, the typing guard: the generated declarations say every projection cell returns and
  takes a C ``bint``, ``long long`` or ``double`` and caches in a C array of the spec's
  size, every new ``Data`` vector but a reader is a typed memoryview or a C scalar, and
  the generated C keeps no Python object in a projection cell's locals, calls no Python
  builtin there and builds no container, under the two directives the build tool writes.
* C4 on the committed points: the compiled model computes what modelx computes, every cell
  at every argument a full modelx sweep caches, every raise and every ``Data`` array, bit
  for bit on x86-64.
* The release: ``run_sec.py --block``, run compiled, holds one point's ItemSpace at a time
  (F5, K2).

The allowlist of cells that stay Python is R17's, :func:`sec_support.reporting_cells`:
``model_point``, the ``result_*`` reports, the ``check_*`` checks, and the label accessors
the registry entry names under ``"reporting"``.  A builtin a compiled cell still calls,
R16's ``round`` of a projected amount, is admitted in that cell alone, by the registry
entry's ``"python_calls"``, which C3 and C5 read.  C3, C4 and the release are marked
``cython``.  They compile each model once a session, into a temporary directory
(``conftest.sec_build``), never into the tree (D12), and run the compiled package in child
processes only.  Without modelx-cython or a C compiler they skip, and the ``cython`` CI job,
which sets ``USLIB_REQUIRE_CYTHON=1``, fails a skip (D13).  Each product module adds what
is its own: C4 on its splice grid and at its contract's extremes, its compiled refusals,
its deepest cold call on a 1 MiB stack, and its runner compiled.

The ``cython`` CI job runs these with the product module's in the model's own leg, one
shard to a leg (``sec_support.cython_shards``), and
:func:`test_the_cython_job_runs_every_shard`, which needs no compiler, holds the job's
matrix to the registry, so that no model at stage ``"EC"`` is left out of it.
