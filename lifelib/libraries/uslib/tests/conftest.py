"""Shared fixtures for the reference-model tests, and the suite's three pytest markers.

The registry these fixtures read — :data:`MODELS`, :data:`LIB` and :func:`model_path` —
lives in :mod:`us_registry` rather than here, and the test modules import it from there.
``conftest.py`` is a name pytest fixes, so with two in-library suites in one run the two
files collide in ``sys.modules`` and each suite can end up locating the *other* library's
models.  See :mod:`us_registry` for the full account.

The ``cython`` marker is registered here rather than in a root ``pytest.ini`` because the
suite ships inside the library, and a copy made by ``lifelib.create()`` carries this file
but no configuration from above it.  The marker is what ``pytest -m cython`` selects the
compile tests by (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md D13), and registering it keeps them free of pytest's
unknown-mark warning.  The tests themselves skip when modelx-cython or a C compiler is
absent, so a bare ``pytest`` stays green on a machine that has neither.  The ``cython`` CI
job, which installs both, sets ``USLIB_REQUIRE_CYTHON=1``, and there such a skip fails.

The ``sec_full`` marker is registered here for the same reason.  It marks the cases of an
SEC model's full splice grid beyond the core that runs by default, which skip, with the
reason shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6), and
``pytest -m sec_full`` selects them.  CI's ``sec`` job sets it on its Linux legs, one
module to a leg, so they run in every CI run, and the ``cython`` job on its Linux leg,
where the compiled grids run at full size.

The ``docutils`` marker is registered here for the same reason.  It marks the tests that
read a model's docstrings through docutils as the docs build does, which skip where
docutils is absent: it is not a requirement of the models, and lifelib's CI does not
install it.  The CI legs that run the full grids install it and set
``USLIB_REQUIRE_DOCUTILS=1``, under which such a skip fails, as ``USLIB_REQUIRE_CYTHON=1``
fails a compile test's (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §5.4).
