"""In-force tests for UL_US_SEC: the splice, future business, counts, regeneration.

``UL_US_SEC`` is ``UL_US_S`` taught to run in force at a valuation date
(USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md, milestone M3).  It runs on two clocks: ``t`` counts months from the
valuation date, the same month for every model point, and ``duration_mth(t)`` counts the
months the policy has been in force, ``duration_mth_init() + t``.  A model point may be a
policy already in force at the valuation date, in any month of its policy year, one issued
at it, or one to be issued after it, as in ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SE``.  A policy in force
opens with six columns of state beside its count: the account value and the loan entering
month 0, which are ``UL_US_S``'s own columns, and the face in force, the free withdrawal
allowance already used in the policy year, the premiums less withdrawals paid to date and
the MEC latch.

The worked example is not restated here.  On a point issued at the valuation date the two
clocks coincide and the model is ``UL_US_S``, and ``test_model_conventions.py`` asserts
that cell by cell on the twins of S's two new-business points (T1), so every golden of
``test_universal_life_us.py`` on S's points 1 and 2, the worked example among them, holds
on this model with no number copied.  S's point 3 is in force at its own month 120, and S
already counts its months from the start of its own projection, so the twin of that point
opens at offset 0 and is a splice case (T2): at the shipped assumptions it is S's point in
every cell but those expense inflation moves, which carries S's goldens on it over.  The
conventions also hold the SEC family's other rules: every frame opens at ``t = 0``,
``pols_if`` is the ``BEF_DECR`` count, ``BEF_DECR`` is ``BEF_NB`` plus the month's new
business, new business enters once, and nothing happens before issue.  This module holds
the rest of the plan's tests (its §5.2) and the product's own facts:

* T2, the splice: an S point restated in force at month ``d``, opened with the state S
  carries into ``d``, continues S's projection from ``d`` on, in every cell of S's,
  ``result_pols`` and ``result_av`` among them.  The months straddle the product's events:
  the first anniversary, where withdrawals open; the surrender charge's first month at
  zero, the lapse shock of the year after it and the per-unit charge's step after year
  10; the month a shortfall begins; the attained age at which the splice's charges cease;
  and the last covered month.  Seven variants of S's points, in a copy of S's table and
  each with input rows of its own, add withdrawals on either death benefit option, a
  single premium with no surrender charge, a TARGET premium on a second schedule, a
  premium that fails the 7-pay and guideline premium tests, the youngest issue age, and a
  premium that takes an Option B account value past the face, where the corridor binds,
  and between them every sex and every class.
* T3, future new business: a point issued ``k`` months after the valuation date is S's
  projection ``k`` months on, with zeros before issue and no rate evaluated there.
* D11's R1 and R2, and D3 and D5's chains: on the splice's grid no cell is called at a
  negative month, none evaluated on the books reads a month before them, and none reads
  beyond ``t + 1``; on the committed points no recursion runs backward over the frame,
  and the policy clock is a closed form; and every chain of the model runs one cell a
  month from a cold start, as far as the contract's longest cover.
* T4, the count algebra: the count rolls forward through new business and decrements,
  ``result_pols`` is S's report with the new business beside it, and multiplying
  ``policy_count`` by 2.5, with every assumption that ships at zero switched on,
  multiplies every flow and moves no per-policy value.
* T5, validation: each malformed in-force row is refused as the table is read, naming its
  point; each assumption table read at a policy year or an age is refused, naming its file
  and the column, if a key is blank, text or fractional, with the lines it is on, or if
  the keys repeat or leave a gap, with each key that repeats, its lines, and each that is
  missing; so is one whose rates, the class factors or the surrender-charge schedules
  hold a value that is blank, text or infinite, with its lines; a text value no decode
  knows raises ``UL_US_S``'s message; the future horizon is a Reference that bounds future
  business, and at 0 refuses it; a point at or past the end of the projection is refused
  by ``proj_len()``; the edges of the interface are accepted, the tables' keys written as
  floats among them, and each rule just outside its window of months; and every state S
  reaches, restated in force, is accepted on each set of inputs S runs on, but an account
  value below 0, which is refused by name.
* T6, regeneration: the committed ``model_point_table_sec.csv`` is what the generator makes
  of ``UL_US_S`` and its table as they stand, and each of its derived and future rows
  projects its S point's numbers from its month on.
* Then the two clocks on the shipped points, S's in-force point as its twin, the values
  outside cover, each new opening-state column on the variants, the survivors the end of
  the projection carries, expense inflation and the declared rates on the valuation
  clock, a check whose residual is not a number, the margin identity once a loan exceeds
  the cash value, a first 7-pay failure in policy year 7, acquisition on new business,
  the mortality cap and a NaN that reaches it, the docstrings, the shared input tables,
  what the default grid reaches, the block, an in-force extract and the runner.
* C2, the fingerprint: every committed point computes what the model computed when Phase 1
  ended, frozen at the end of this module before Phase 2 changed anything (§5.4).

SEC month ``t`` is S month ``t + source_mth`` throughout, the direction in which
``sec_support`` takes its ``t_offset``: ``d`` for a point restated at S month ``d``, 0 for
the twin of S's point 3, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months on.

**The core grid and the full one** (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6).  A UL projection runs 1,032
months, and T2 and T3 over every case, 54 splices and 11 future points, would take this
module far past three minutes in every run.  By default they run a core of 20 and 5
cases, chosen so that between them they reach every branch, every opening-state column,
every kind of valuation month and every premium pattern the full grid reaches, which
``test_the_core_grid_reaches_every_branch`` asserts.  UL premiums are monthly, the one
mode the product models, so there is no mode to reach.  The other cases, and the rules
test's scan of their rows, carry the ``sec_full`` marker and are skipped, with the reason
shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set.  They are never dropped: one leg of the CI
matrix sets it, so every CI run runs the full grid, and
``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1 python -m pytest -m sec_full tests/test_universal_life_us_sec.py`` runs
them alone.  Memory is the other cost: a projected point holds tens of megabytes of
cached values and their dependency graph, so a row read once, a splice case's or a point
of a temporary copy, is released as soon as it has been read (``_release``), and the
splice's rows are held one at a time, however large the grid.

Every test keeps five rules.  Each model is read under a name of its own and closed:
``test_universal_life_us.py`` reads S under its default name, and reading a model under a
name in use renames the open one.  Every Reference a test sets, ``Data``'s included, is
set on a model just read, before anything is computed: a compiled model never clears a
cache.  No test writes inside the library tree: every changed input goes through
``sec_support.temp_inputs`` into a temporary directory, because a CSV added beside the
models, even briefly, would fail a concurrent
``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read``.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by
hand: the keys come from ``us_registry.point_keys`` and the ItemSpaces from
``us_registry.projection``, and a generated row is found by what it is, its kind, its S
policy and its month (``_row``), so neither a renumbered table nor Phase 2's positions can
point a test at the wrong row.  The one exception is a table ``Data`` refuses, which has
no keys to give: its first row's key is taken from the parameter (``_first_key``).  And a
timing or a kind is passed through ``_code``, which gives the model's Reference of that
name where the model defines one and the string otherwise, and every cell-by-cell
comparison goes through ``_twin``: Phase 2 changes the call syntax only (C1), each in one
place.  At stage ``"EC"``, where the model now stands, the codes are the model's int
References (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md R9), ``Projection`` is keyed by position, and ``_twin`` maps
S's ``claims(t, None)`` onto the total ``claims(t)``.

# What the splice sets in both models, S and SEC alike, before either evaluates anything.
# Expense inflation is the one input UL reads on the valuation clock that moves (D7): S
# inflates from issue and SEC from the valuation date, so at the shipped 2.5% the expenses
# of a point opened at d differ by design, and at 0 both factors are 1.  The clock itself
# is then asserted on its own, at the shipped rate.  The declared rates are flat as
# shipped, so no input table moves with d, and their clock is asserted with a formula
# override, which the splice leaves alone so that it runs unchanged once the model compiles
# (K7); that test also moves the dynamic lapse multiplier off 1 and compares the result
# with S.  The rest switch on what the shipped values leave unreached:
#   expense_acq, which ships at 0, so that acquisition on future business shows at all;
#   mort_ae_factor at 0.56, which leaves lives at the end of every frame, so that the
#     survivors carried into t = proj_len(), which S's roll-forwards read there, are
#     compared on every row, and which keeps every class's annual rate below 1, StdTob's
#     oldest at 1.75 x 0.56 = 0.98: at an A/E of 1 its product passes 1 at attained age
#     113, where both models cap it (the mortality cap test);
#   charges_cease_age at 100, inside every frame, where the shipped 121 is one past the
#     table's last age: premiums, charges and withdrawals cease in cover, at attained age
#     100, policy month 780 at issue age 35;
#   lapse_shock_mult at 10, so that the shock year's rate, 0.04 x 10, meets the lapse
#     rate's cap of 0.35, which the shipped multiplier of 2 never reaches.

    death benefit, the loan, the face, the opening state, the tax tests, the rates, both

# Each malformed table is the committed one with one fault.  The checks run over the whole
# table as it is read, in Data, and the message names the file it read and the column or
# every point at fault.  A blank cell reads as NaN, and so does a text cell once the checks
# coerce the column to numbers, so each is refused as a count, a duration or a balance
# that is not a number.  The repeated point_id holds another policy under the same label,
# as a bad extract would, so that the check must look at the labels and not at whole rows.
# The point_ids are the committed table's: 1 and 2, S's new business; 3, S's in-force
# point at 120; 4, S point 1 at 12, the first anniversary; 5, S point 1 at 113; 6, S point
# 3 six months on, at 126; 7, S point 2 at 676; 8, S point 1 at 1008; 9, issued 25 months
# on.  Each check over a window of policy months is refused in the window's first month and
# its last, where an off-by-one would let a row through (§5.2, T5, precised at M10): the
# year's usage on the first anniversary and on later ones; the face above 0 and at most the
# face at issue from month 1, the first in force; and the MEC latch from month 1 to month
# 84, whose month before is in policy year 7, the last the 7-pay test runs in, and at 12,
# whose month before is in policy year 1, a cent past that year's limit.  The edges test
# and test_each_rule_reads_the_months_just_outside_it read the months just outside, 11 and
# 13, 0 and 85, and the latch at the limit.  A {file} in a message is the table's

    the first capped month dies in it, and none is in force after it.  ``result_cf()``,
    ``result_pols()`` and ``result_av()`` hold finite floats alone, and both checks hold.

    Each of the first three rows below agrees with S in every cell, as T1, T3 and the
    splice compare them (:data:`FUTURE_EXEMPT`, :data:`SPLICE_EXEMPT`: ``result_pols`` by
    its columns), at every argument S cached (``sec_support.twin_mismatches``), the capped
    months, ``result_cf()`` and ``result_av()`` included, but, in the issue month, the
    count before new business, which S counts as in force (:func:`_issued_later`).  It
    holds them to 1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, because the count before the cap
    falls to 2.1e-13, where the default floor of 1e-9 would compare it against nothing.
    S is swept as the splice sweeps it (:func:`_sweep_s`), and every monthly cell in
    every month (:func:`_sweep_months`).

    Four rows of the point, built from S by the generator under :data:`CAPPED_REFS`:
    issued at the valuation date and 25 months after it; restated in force in the month
    before the cap, opened with S's count and state there, and compared cell by cell as a
    splice row is; and restated five months into the capped year, opened with S's state
    there and one policy, since S's count there is 0.  On each, the rate is 1.0 from its
    first capped month, every policy in force there dies in it, and the count is 0.0
    after it.

    thread whose stack is reserved at 1 MiB stands in for it on every platform

    Windows or from glibc, and must be at most 1 MiB and a page: a stand-in larger than
    asked for would stand for nothing.  And the calls run again on the child's main
    thread, which is what ``run_sec.py --cython`` runs on.

    No run has measured what the calls need with MSVC.  So they run first at each size of
    :data:`STACK_KIB`, before anything is asserted, and every size's outcome goes into a
    warning, which the job's summary shows, and into the failure, if there is one: the
    smallest size that ran bounds the stack the chain needs on the compiler at hand.  A
    size below the need kills its child on a stack overflow, by design: with gcc, 256 KiB
    does.  Each bracketing child is waited for :data:`BRACKET_TIMEOUT` seconds and the two
    asserted runs :data:`ASSERTED_TIMEOUT`, so that an overflow that hangs, rather than
    ends its child, costs minutes, not the job's hour, and a bracketing size that timed
    out is recorded as such.

    modelx recomputes what a Reference reaches when it is set.  The compiled model clears

    keep the values they computed, and only an ItemSpace made afterwards, which takes the
    References when it is made, computes with the new value.  The Projection docstring
    and ``model-sec.md`` say so, and tell a user to set every Reference on a model just
    imported.  This holds the compiled model to what they say, on ``inflation_rate``,
    which moves ``expenses(12)`` on every point in force then: the base ``Projection``,
    the worked example's twin at ``idx`` 0, S's in-force point's twin, made before, and
    S's point 1 restated at its month 12, made after, so that a modelx-cython that began
    to clear caches would be seen here, and the advice changed with it.  A compiled value
