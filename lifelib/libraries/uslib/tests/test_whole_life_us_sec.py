"""In-force tests for WholeLife_US_SEC: the splice, future business, counts, regeneration.

``WholeLife_US_SEC`` is ``WholeLife_US_S`` taught to run in force at a valuation date
(USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md, milestone M2).  It runs on two clocks: ``t`` counts months from the
valuation date, the same month for every model point, and ``duration_mth(t)`` counts the
months the policy has been in force, ``duration_mth_init() + t``.  A model point may be a
policy already in force at the valuation date, in any month of its policy year, one issued
at it, or one to be issued after it, as in ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SE``.  A policy in force
opens with seven columns of state beside its count: the paid-up additions, the loan and
the accumulation balance entering month 0, the paid-up additions and the loan at the
anniversary that opened its policy year, the dividend credited there, and the gross
premium paid to date.

The worked example is not restated here.  On a point issued at the valuation date the two
clocks coincide and the model is ``WholeLife_US_S``, and ``test_model_conventions.py``
asserts that cell by cell on the twins of S's fourteen new-business points (T1), so every
golden of ``test_whole_life_us.py`` on them holds on this model with no number copied.
The worked example itself sits on S's point 1, in force at its month 108.  Its twin is a
splice case (T2), and at the shipped assumptions it is S's point from month 108 on, in
every cell but those expense inflation moves.  The conventions also hold the SEC family's
other rules: every frame opens at ``t = 0``, ``pols_if`` is the ``BEF_DECR`` count,
``BEF_DECR`` is ``BEF_NB`` plus the month's new business, new business enters once, and
nothing happens before issue.  This module holds the rest of the plan's tests (its §5.2)
and the product's own facts:

* T2, the splice: an S point restated in force at month ``d``, opened with the state S
  carries into ``d``, continues S's projection from ``d`` on, in every cell of S's and in
  ``result_pols``.  The months straddle the policy year: its first month, its middle and
  its last, which credits the dividend; then the late years and the last covered month.
  They run on every dividend option, the loan, the PUA rider, both term blends, limited
  pay, final expense level and graded, and the female cell, and five variants of S's
  points, in a copy of S's table, add the rider paid monthly, REDUCE_PREM paid
  semi-annually, the graded plan paid quarterly, and premiums paid for twenty years and to
  attained age 65.
* T3, future new business: a point issued ``k`` months after the valuation date is S's
  projection ``k`` months on, with zeros before issue and no rate evaluated there.
* D11's R1 and R2, and D3's clock: on the splice's grid no cell is called at a negative
  month, none evaluated on the books reads a month before them, and none reads beyond
  ``t + 1`` but the term blend's one read of the dividend at the anniversary that closes
  its year; on the committed points no recursion runs backward over the frame; the
  policy clock is a closed form; and every chain of the model runs one cell a month from
  a cold start, as far as the contract's longest cover.
* T4, the count algebra: the count rolls forward through new business and decrements,
  ``result_pols`` is S's report with the new business beside it, multiplying
  ``policy_count`` by 2.5, with the switches that ship off switched on, multiplies every
  flow and every counted cell by 2.5 and moves no per-policy value, and the count's check,
  whose tolerance scales with the count, closes on a million policies.
* T5, validation: each malformed in-force row is refused as the table is read, naming its
  point, each rule over a window of months just inside its edges; the future horizon is
  a Reference that bounds future business, and at 0 refuses it; a point past maturity is
  refused by ``proj_len()``, and so is a point the contract does not issue; the edges of
  the interface, and of every range ``Data`` holds a value to, are accepted; and so is
  every state ``WholeLife_US_S`` reaches, on each set of inputs on which those states
  differ.
* Phase 2's decoding: what ``Data`` cannot decode is refused by name, a key written as
  text among it, and so is a read beyond a table, whose padding is NaN; a key written as
  a float reads as ``WholeLife_US_S`` reads it; and a value a cap, a ``min`` or a ``max``
  reads, an amount, a share, a rate or a net single premium, is a number in its range,
  or ``Data`` refuses it, blank, text, infinite or outside it, naming the file, the
  column and every line, schedule or point at fault, when its array is first read.
* T6, regeneration: the committed ``model_point_table_sec.csv`` is what the generator makes
  of ``WholeLife_US_S`` and its table as they stand.
* Then the two clocks on the shipped points, the worked example's pre-frame values as the
  opening state, a policy valued mid-year, the dividend options and the graded benefit in
  force, the last dividend, expense inflation on the valuation clock, acquisition on new
  business, the cap on mortality and a NaN that reaches it, the values outside cover, the
  block, an in-force extract, the runner and its block's sum, the docstrings, the shared
  input tables, and what the default grid reaches; and what Phase 2 split or decoded,
  held to S: the claims total, bit for bit, every premium period, a dividend option none
  of the four, and rounding switched off, which is a digit count below -400.
* C2, the fingerprint: every committed point computes what the model computed when Phase 1
  ended, frozen at the end of this module before Phase 2 changed anything (§5.4).
* Compiled (marked ``cython``): C4 on the splice grid, at the contract's extremes and where
  the cap binds, the compiled model refusing what modelx refuses, the deepest cold call on
  a 1 MiB stack, a Reference set late, which clears no compiled cache, and the runner
  compiled.  ``test_compiled_conventions.py`` holds the rest of Phase 2's tests for every
  compiled model: C3, C5, C4 on the committed points and the release.

SEC month ``t`` is S month ``t + source_mth`` throughout, the direction in which
``sec_support`` takes its ``t_offset``: ``d`` for a point restated at S month ``d``, 108
for the twin of S's point 1, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months on.

**The core grid and the full one** (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6).  A WholeLife projection costs
about ten times a Term one, and T2 and T3 over every point at every month, 107 cases and
34, would nearly double this module's run time in every run.  By default they run a
core of 35 and 9 cases, chosen so that between them they reach every branch, every
opening-state column, every kind of valuation month and every premium mode the full grid
reaches, which ``test_the_core_grid_reaches_every_branch`` asserts.  The other cases, and
the rules test's scan of their rows, carry the ``sec_full`` marker and are skipped, with
the reason shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set.  They are never dropped: one leg of
the CI matrix sets it, so every CI run runs the full grid, and
``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1 python -m pytest -m sec_full tests/test_whole_life_us_sec.py`` runs
them alone.  The compiled comparison on the splice grid follows the same split through
the splice's fixture, and carries no ``sec_full`` marker, since the cython job fails a
compile test that skips.  Memory is the other cost: a projected point holds about 40 MB of
cached values and their dependency graph, so a row read once, a splice case's or a point
of a temporary copy, is released as soon as it has been read (``_release``), and the
splice's rows are held one at a time, however large the grid.

Every test keeps four rules.  Each model is read under a name of its own and closed:
``test_whole_life_us.py`` reads S under its default name, and reading a model under a name
in use renames the open one.  No test writes inside the library tree: every changed input
goes through ``sec_support.temp_inputs`` into a temporary directory, because a CSV added
beside the models, even briefly, would fail a concurrent
``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read``.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by
hand: the keys come from ``us_registry.point_keys`` and the ItemSpaces from
``us_registry.projection``, and a generated row is found by what it is, its kind, its S
policy and its month (``_row``), so neither a renumbered table nor Phase 2's positions can
point a test at the wrong row.  And a timing or a kind is passed as the model's int
Reference of its name, ``pols_if_at(t, p.BEF_DECR)``, as at stage ``"EC"``, where Phase 2
made the strings int codes and changed the call syntax only (C1); comparing with S, which
passes the strings, maps one onto the other through ``sec_support.codes``.

# a point opened at d differ by 1.02^(d/12), by design, and at 0 both factors are 1.  The
# clock itself is then asserted on its own, at the shipped rate.  There is no scenario
# table and no mortality improvement, so no input table moves with d.  The rest are
# switches that ship off, or at a value that hides some of the state from any comparison:
#   pua_div_on, the PUA-block dividend, without which the paid-up additions at the
#     anniversary are read by the term blend alone;
#   prem_offset_on, the premium-offset overlay, without which last year's dividend reaches
#     the premium under REDUCE_PREM alone;
#   dyn_lapse_on, the dynamic lapse overlay, at a competitor rate of 8% for a factor of
#     1.02, so that its cell is reached at all;
#   int_rate_loan apart from the shipped dividend rate: at i_L = i_d the loan cancels out
#     of the dividend's interest margin, and a wrong loan at the anniversary would show in

    Each is a rule of how the model computes, not of what, so no number shows a breach,
    and on a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and hide it from T1 too.
    The splice's rows are points in force at every month T2 names, the variants among them,
    and points issued later, and on each the four reports are run first:

    * R1: no cell holds a negative argument.  modelx evaluates one without complaint, and
      a compiled cache raises ``IndexError`` below 0 (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md F4).  A policy
      month turned into ``t`` by subtracting ``duration_mth_init()`` (R1a) goes negative
      on a point in force past it, and so does a balance read a month or a year back
      without the opening state's branch.  The keys of ``cv_pp_anniv``, ``nsp`` and
      ``mort_rate_guar_at``, a policy year and ages, are held to it too: a schedule read
      at a policy year before issue would wrap round in a compiled model.
    * R1's look-back stops at ``t_entry()``: no cell evaluated at a month from
      ``t_entry()`` on read a month before it.  On a point issued later a recursion based
      at ``t == 0`` reads the pre-issue zeros, so no number shows it and no argument goes
      negative.
    * R2's look-ahead: no cell evaluated at month ``t`` read a cell keyed by a month beyond
      ``t + 1``, as modelx's dependency graph records each cached call's precedents, with
      one exception, :data:`LOOK_AHEAD`'s, admitted at the anniversary closing the policy
      year of ``t`` and nowhere else, and asserted to occur.  ``WholeLife_US_S``'s
      ``anniv_mth`` returned a policy month, which on this clock lands a policy's age away.

    And no month of any row has claims of all three kinds, so ``claims(t)``, the three
    summed left to right, is ``WholeLife_US_S``'s compensated ``sum`` on every row too
    (:func:`test_the_claims_total_is_s_claims_bit_for_bit`).

    Each row was scanned by the T2 or T3 case that compared it (:func:`_settle`), and a
    row no case has scanned is scanned here.  The core case covers the core's rows, the
    full case every other row of the full grid, with ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``.  The
    new-business twins in the splice's table are no case's, and are left out: on them the
    clocks coincide, and T1 compares them with S cell by cell.  The closed-form clock and
    the recursion depth are asserted on the committed model, in the test after this one.

# Each malformed table is the committed one with one fault.  The checks run over the whole
# table as it is read, in Data, and the message names the file it read and the column or
# every point at fault.  A blank cell reads as NaN, and so does a text cell once the checks
# coerce the column to numbers, so each is refused as a count, a duration or a balance
# that is not a number.  The repeated point_id holds another policy under the same label,
# as a bad extract would, so that the check must look at the labels and not at whole rows.
# The point_ids are the committed table's: 16 and 17, REDUCE_PREM and ACCUM valued on the
# anniversary at 108; 18, the funded blend mid-year at 78; 19, the loan mid-year at 114;
# 20, the graded plan at 18; 21, REDUCE_PREM in its last month; 22, issued 3 months on.
# The two checks that turn on the policy year are tested at their edges, where an
# off-by-one would let a row through: a row moved to months 1 and 11, the ends of the
# first policy year, and to month 12, the first anniversary, where the anniversary columns
# are the ones entering month 0.  The edges test reads the months either side, 11, 12 and
# 13, and month 1, the first after a policy not yet in force, which holds no state
# (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §5.2, T5, precised at M10).  The anniversary's columns hold one
# amount at one instant, so the check is exact (D6): it refuses them a cent apart either
# way, the least an extract carrying cents can show, and an ulp apart either way, the least
# two doubles can be, which the CSV keeps, as well as further.  A {file} in a message is
# the table's filename: every case is read by one model, from a file of its own (the

    nothing else.  So afterwards none of :data:`IN_COVER_ONLY` may hold a value at all:
    ``is_active``'s docstring promises that outside cover no count evaluates a rate, and no
    table is read at a policy year or an attained age the policy does not have.

    The committed table's one point issued after the valuation date is S's point 2, which
    has no rider, no blend, no loan and neither ACCUM nor REDUCE_PREM, so on it a cell tied
    to one of those would hold zero before issue, guarded or not.  So the same scan runs on
    the splice's future rows, the core's or, with ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``, all of them: the
    rider and the funded blend (S points 8 and 16), ACCUM, REDUCE_PREM and the graded plan
    among them.  Each row is made afresh first and released after.

    Several of these guards change no number the frame shows: once the counts are zero
    outside cover, every cash flow is too, and an unguarded value multiplies a zero count.
    They are held here because they are what the docstrings promise a caller, and because
    Phase 2 needs them: a table read at a policy year or an age the policy does not have
    would wrap round in a compiled model rather than fail (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md F4, R1).

    The default run thins the splice to a core (the module docstring), and this test is
    what keeps the thinning from costing a branch.  First, statically, over S's table with
    the variants, each property below holds of some core case: every dividend option, the
    loan, the rider on annual mode and on another, a funded and an unfunded blend, limited
    pay, every premium period, final expense level and graded, inside the graded years
    and after them, the female cell, each premium mode, S's in-force row as its twin and
    restated, and each
    kind of valuation month: on an anniversary, the first among them with additions
    already bought, mid-year, in the anniversary month with years still to run, in the last
    five policy years, and in the last covered month.  And
    of some core future case: issued off the valuation anniversaries and on them, more than
    a year on, final expense, monthly mode, the rider.

    Then, on the splice's model, of some core row, each of :data:`AT_VALUATION` and
    :data:`IN_FRAME`, what no column of the table shows:

    * every opening-state column is non-zero, and each anniversary column differs from its
      current one, so that a column read in its pair's place would show;
    * a row valued on its first anniversary holds additions there, so that a first-year
      check that ran a month too long would refuse it;
    * every read of the state at the anniversary before the valuation date is taken, with
      that value apart from the current one: the PUA-block dividend, the loan interest and
      the term-blend gap of the year under way, a premium net of ``div_prev_anniv_init``,
      and the graded death benefit on ``prem_cum_init``;
    * every branch the dividend drives later in the frame is taken: the REDUCE_PREM excess
      buying additions, the premium-offset overlay, the blend's cap binding, a blend past
      its crossover, and the last dividend buying additions at maturity.

    Each core row's branches were recorded by the T2 case that compared it
    (:func:`_settle`), and a row no case has recorded is evaluated here.

    On the five points of :func:`_contract_extremes` issued at age 0, whose cover runs
    1,200 months, a cold ``net_cf`` in the last month runs the count chain from the end
    of the frame back to ``t_entry``, 1,211 cells deep in modelx on a model just read
    (:func:`test_every_chain_runs_one_cell_a_month_from_a_cold_start`), and compiled it
    runs on the C stack, which the interpreter's recursion limit does not count.  1 MiB
    is the stack MSVC gives an executable's main thread unless the executable asks for
    more: a host that embeds Python, where python.exe itself asks for 2,000,000 bytes.  A
    thread whose stack is reserved at 1 MiB stands in for it on every platform
    (``sec_support.run_compiled``), and in one each call runs cold and returns modelx's
    number, identically on x86-64 (``sec_support.exact_here``) and to 1e-12 elsewhere.
    With gcc the calls need about 290 KiB.  A stack too small kills the child, and the
    test fails naming the stack.  The thread's stack is read back too, from Windows or
    from glibc, and must be at most 1 MiB and a page: a stand-in larger than asked for
    would stand for nothing.  And the calls run again on the child's main thread, which is
    what ``run_sec.py --cython`` runs on.

    No run has measured what the calls need with MSVC.  So they run first at each size of
    :data:`STACK_KIB`, before anything is asserted, and every size's outcome goes into a
    warning, which the job's summary shows, and into the failure, if there is one: the
    smallest size that ran bounds the stack the chain needs on the compiler at hand.  A
    size below the need kills its child on a stack overflow, by design: with gcc, 256 KiB
    does.  Each bracketing child is waited for :data:`BRACKET_TIMEOUT` seconds and the two
    asserted runs :data:`ASSERTED_TIMEOUT`, so that an overflow that hangs, rather than
    ends its child, costs minutes, not the job's hour, and a bracketing size that timed
    out is recorded as such.

    keep the values they computed, and only an ItemSpace made afterwards, which takes the

    and ``model-sec.md`` say so, and tell a user to set every Reference on a model just
    imported.  This holds the compiled model to what they say, on ``inflation_rate``,
    which moves ``expenses(12)`` on every point in force then: the base ``Projection``,
    the anchor cell, and the twins of S's points 2 and 3, made before and after, so that a
    modelx-cython that began to clear caches would be seen here, and the advice changed
