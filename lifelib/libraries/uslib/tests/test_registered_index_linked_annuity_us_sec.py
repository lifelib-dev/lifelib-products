"""In-force tests for RILA_US_SEC: the splice, future business, counts, regeneration.

``RILA_US_SEC`` is ``RILA_US_S`` taught to run in force at a valuation date
(USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md, milestone M10).  It runs on two clocks: ``t`` counts months from the
valuation date, the same month for every model point, and ``duration_mth(t)`` counts the
months from issue, ``duration_mth_init() + t``.  A model point may be a contract already in
force at the valuation date, in any month of any term, one issued at it, or one issued up
to ten years after it, as in ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SE``.  A contract in force opens with
thirteen columns of state beside its count: seven amounts per contract entering month 0,
the Investment Amount, the Fixed and Holding Accounts, the Account Value, of either sign,
the Account Value before withdrawals at the anniversary on or before the valuation date,
the Free Withdrawal Amount still unused and the return-of-premium base; and, where the term
under way began before the valuation month, the index level, the Market Value Rate and the
option-pricing market of its Term Start Date, with the cap re-solved there at a renewal
under ``nge_reset``.  The market runs on the valuation clock, each row restated in force or
issued later reading its own copy of its scenario re-based to its month,
``market_scenario_sec.csv``; the terms, the anniversaries, the withdrawal programme and the
Maturity Date stay on the policy clock.

The worked example is not restated here.  On a point issued at the valuation date the two
clocks coincide and the model is ``RILA_US_S``, and ``test_model_conventions.py`` asserts
that cell by cell on the twins of S's fifteen points (T1), so every golden of
``test_registered_index_linked_annuity_us.py`` on a cell S's sweep reaches holds on this
model with no number copied: the worked example's table, the option budget and its
decomposition, the withdrawal-charge example and the term-end identity.  The conventions
also hold the SEC family's other rules: every frame opens at ``t = 0``, ``pols_if`` is the
``BEF_DECR`` count, ``BEF_DECR`` is ``BEF_NB`` plus the month's new business, new business
enters once, and nothing happens before issue.  This module holds the rest of the plan's
tests (its §5.2) and the product's own facts:

* T2, the splice: an S point restated in force at month ``d``, opened with the state S
  carries into ``d``, continues S's projection from ``d`` on, in every cell of S's and in
  ``result_pols``.  The months straddle each term end and renewal, 35, 36, 59, 60, 71 and
  72, a month mid-term, the anniversaries 12 and 24 and a year's last month, on stepped
  copies of the market paths, every field of which steps, each row valued mid-term on a
  copy whose state at ``t = 0`` is moved off its term-start columns, and ten variants of
  S's points, in a copy of S's table, reach what S's own points cannot: a three-year
  term, a one-year term under ``nge_reset``, a behavioural rate above the free rate, a
  Floor option whose cap binds, a crash path that takes the interim value below 0, a
  withdrawal above the account value, on the crash path a behavioural rate above the free
  rate and a positive request on a negative account value, an Edge term ending exactly at
  its buffer, and a withdrawal at a negative interim value on a positive account value,
  which the accounts alone pay.
* T3, future new business: a contract issued ``k`` months after the valuation date is S's
  projection ``k`` months on, with zeros before it, no rate evaluated there, and its own
  scenario, which holds no level before its issue month.
* D11's R1, R1a and R2, and D3's clock: on the splice's grid no cell is called at a
  negative argument, nor a keyed table read at a key the contract does not have, none
  evaluated on the books reads a month before them, and none reads beyond ``t + 1``; on
  the committed points no recursion runs backward over the frame, a cold call runs one
  cell a month, and the policy clock is a closed form.
* T4, the count algebra: the count rolls forward through new business and decrements,
  ``result_pols`` is S's report with the new business beside it, multiplying
  ``policy_count`` by 2.5, with every assumption that ships at zero switched on,
  multiplies every flow and moves no per-contract value, and the checks' tolerances scale
  with the count.
* T5, validation: each malformed in-force row is refused as the table is read, naming its
  point, and again through a projection; each malformed assumption table, a key or a
  value, by the count cell beside its reader, naming the file's lines; a point at or past
  its maturity, or carrying more free withdrawal than its year allows, is refused by
  ``proj_len()``; a value no decode knows is refused where the projection meets it; the
  future horizon is a Reference that bounds future business; and every state S reaches,
  on the splice's inputs and on its shipped ones, the edges of the interface, and keys
  written as floats, are accepted.
* T6, regeneration: the committed ``model_point_table_sec.csv`` and
  ``market_scenario_sec.csv`` are what the generator makes of ``RILA_US_S`` and its inputs
  as they stand, and each derived and future row in them is its S point from its month
  on, frame by frame and cell by cell.
* Then the product's own facts: the two clocks, the opening state as S carries it, each
  column shown on a committed row, a term begun before the valuation date, the cap
  re-solved at a renewal, a renewal at the valuation date, the year's free-withdrawal
  state, withdrawals on the policy clock, the scenario and expense inflation on the
  valuation clock, the capped mortality rate, the checks failing a residual that is not a
  number, the premium and acquisition on new business, the values outside cover, the
  set-apart inputs, the block, an in-force extract, the runner, the docstrings and their
  tables, the shared input tables, and what the default grid reaches.
* C2, the fingerprint: every committed point computes what the model computed when Phase 1
  ended, frozen at the end of this module before Phase 2 changed anything (§5.4).
* Stage EC, what compiling changed, held in modelx: the spec's sizes and the sample's
  recursion limit and label trace held to their derivations; S's totals and their sign of
  zero, a withdrawal over three buckets summed as S's ``sum``, the leg codes and the
  inlined Black-Scholes engine, each bit for bit; the cap solved once a term; every
  parameterless cell a Python number and every ``Data`` vector the dtype its docstring
  states, padded with NaN; the decodes and the numberings; the powers taken off their
  domain beside S's outcome, the issue ages and attained ages the caches cannot hold, and
  a whole number of ``2**53`` or more, each refused by its point; and the runner's build,
  its extension check and its block sum.
* Compiled (``cython``): the compiled model computes what modelx computes on the splice
  grid, at the contract's extremes, under moved References, a NaN through each among them,
  on labels that are not text, on keys written as floats and out of order and on keys far
  past every frame, at every power off its domain and in the total's sign of zero; it
  refuses what modelx refuses and, alone, past its caches; the deepest cold call runs on
  a 1 MiB stack and on the main thread; a Reference set late clears no cache; and the
  runner prints what modelx prints.

SEC month ``t`` is S month ``t + source_mth`` throughout, the direction in which
``sec_support`` takes its ``t_offset``: ``d`` for a point restated at S month ``d``, ``-k``
for one issued ``k`` months on.  ``RILA_US_S`` has no point in force, so every twin is new
business, compared by T1, and every splice case is a derived row.

**The core grid and the full one** (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6).  T2 and T3 over every month the
product's events need, 101 splices and 16 future points, would take this module well past
three minutes in every run.  By default they run a core of 37 and 6, chosen so that
between them they reach every crediting method, interim-value family, amortization rule,
scenario and programme, ``nge_reset`` both ways, every opening-state column, every kind of
valuation month and every property ``test_the_core_grid_reaches_every_branch`` lists,
which between them run every line the full grid runs (measured at M10).  The other cases,
and the rules test's scan of their rows, carry the ``sec_full`` marker and are skipped,
with the reason shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set.  They are never dropped: one
leg of the CI matrix sets it, and ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1 python -m pytest -m sec_full`` on
this module runs them alone.  Memory is the other cost.  A projected point holds its
cached values and their dependency graph, so a row read once, a splice case's or a point
of a temporary copy, is released as soon as it has been read (``_release``), and the
splice's rows are held one at a time, however large the grid.  The models the module
sweeps once and holds are frozen out of the collector (``gc.freeze``), so that a
collection scans only what a test has made since, and the freeze is undone as the module
ends (:func:`_freeze`).

Every test keeps four rules.  Each model is read under a name of its own and closed:
``test_registered_index_linked_annuity_us.py`` reads S under its default name, and reading
a model under a name in use renames the open one.  No test writes inside the library tree:
every changed input goes through ``sec_support.temp_inputs`` into a temporary directory,
because a CSV added beside the models, even briefly, would fail a concurrent
``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read``.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by
hand: the keys come from ``us_registry.point_keys`` and the ItemSpaces from
``us_registry.projection``, and a generated row is found by what it is, its kind, its S
policy and its month (``_row``), so neither a renumbered table nor Phase 2's positions can
point a test at the wrong row.  And every Reference a test changes, ``Data``'s included, is
set on a model just read, before it computes anything, because a compiled model never
clears a cache; timings, kinds and buckets pass through :func:`_code`, and every twin
comparison through :func:`_mismatches`, so that the same calls serve Phase 2's int codes
(C1).

# expenses of a point opened at d differ by design, and at 0 both factors are 1; the clock
# itself is asserted on its own, at the shipped rate.  The rest ship at a value that hides
# some of the state from any comparison:
#   roll_transfer_holding ships at 0, the Holding Account's share of a term end, and is
#     switched on at 4%, with the Fixed Account's 15% moved to 11%, so that the four shares

#     binds it nowhere and 30 everywhere it reaches, either of which hides a multiplier

    own copy of S's, ``{id}-F{k}``, moved ``k`` months later, which holds no level before
    the issue month, so that a read there raises inside the comparison.

    The last assertions are R1 and D4's base rule made testable.  After every report, no
    decrement rate keyed by month has been evaluated at a month before issue, and the
    mortality table has not been read below the issue age, nor the surrender table below
    contract year 1.  A count, a balance or a carry based at ``t == 0`` rather than at
    ``t_entry()``, or a rate that reads its table before asking whether the month is in
    cover, still gives the right numbers.  The rules test's look-back and the guard test
    see the first too, and the guard test the second.

    The pre-issue rows are asserted present before they are asserted zero: a frame that
    opened at issue would have none, its zeros would hold of nothing, and the comparisons
    with S, which start there, would not see it.  The row is swept and recorded for the
    rules test first (:func:`_record`), and released after.  The S point is swept here,
    where T2 has released it.

    Each is a rule of how the model computes, not of what, so no number shows a breach,
    and on a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and hide it from T1 too.
    The splice's rows are points in force at every month T2 names, the variants among
    them, and points issued later, and each was swept first:

    * R1: no cell holds a negative argument.  modelx evaluates one without complaint, and
      a compiled cache raises ``IndexError`` below 0 (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md F4).  A policy
      month turned into ``t`` by subtracting ``duration_mth_init()`` (R1a) goes negative on
      a row valued after it: the Term Start Date of a term begun before the valuation
      month, and the anniversary month whose ``"BEF_WD"`` value is the year's
      free-withdrawal base.  So does a balance or a count read a month back without the
      opening state's branch, and ``RILA_US_S``'s ``market_state(k)`` would fail there on
      ``max([])``.
    * R1's look-back stops at ``t_entry()``: no cell evaluated at a month from
      ``t_entry()`` on read a month before it.  On a point issued later a recursion based
      at ``t == 0`` reads the months before, where every balance is 0, so no number shows
      it and no argument goes negative.
    * R1a's keys: the mortality table is read at attained ages from the first month on the
      books to the last covered one, the surrender table at contract years from that
      month's to the Maturity Date's, the withdrawal charges at complete years the contract
      has, and the withdrawal programme at policy month ends from the first on the books to
      the Maturity Date (:func:`_contract`): a table read at a key before the valuation
      date, or one the contract does not have, would wrap round in a compiled model.
    * R2's look-ahead: no cell evaluated at month ``t`` read a cell keyed by a month beyond
      ``t + 1``, as modelx's dependency graph records each cached call's precedents, read
      directly or through a precedent keyed by no month, which is followed to the
      month-keyed calls it reads (:func:`_months_read`).  The market is read at the month
      end, ``t + 1``, and the count carried out of the month, ``pols_if_at(t + 1,
      "BEF_NB")``, by the Account Value after the withdrawal and the count's roll-forward;
      RILA admits no other look-ahead.

    Each row was scanned by the T2 or T3 case that compared it (:func:`_record`), and a row
    no case has scanned is scanned here.  The core case covers the core's rows, the full
    case every other row of the full grid, with ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``.  The twins in the
    splice's table are no case's, and are left out: on them the clocks coincide, and T1
    compares them with S cell by cell.  The closed-form clock and the recursion depth are
    asserted on the committed model, in the tests after this one.

#
# Each malformed table is the committed one with one fault, and only the rule under test
# refuses it.  The checks run over the whole table as it is read, in Data, and the message
# names the file it read and the column or every point at fault.  A blank cell reads as
# NaN, and so does a text cell once the checks coerce the column to numbers, so each is
# refused as a count, a duration, an age, a rate, a balance or a market value that is not
# a number.  The repeated point_id holds another contract under the same label, as a bad
# extract would, so that the check must look at the labels and not at whole rows.  The
# point_ids are the committed table's: 16, the anchor in the last month of its first term,
# with every term-start column; 17, the worked example's programme on the anniversary after
# its withdrawal, its remainder partly used; 18, the nge_reset point mid-term after its
# first renewal, with its re-solved cap; 19, the same at that renewal, its term-start
# columns blank; 20, the Step option on a one-year term mid-term; 22, the uncapped option
# mid-term; 23, the notional family in its last covered month; 24, the anchor issued 13
# months on; and the twins 1, the anchor, and 13, nge_reset.
#
# Where the docs say a check runs before another, its case sits on a row the later check
# would refuse differently, so that a check moved after it fails its case: term_years 2.5
# on row 20, where the presence rule, reading the term as written, would refuse its
# term-start columns, and nge_reset on row 20, where it would ask for a cap.  The rules
# that hold a window of contract months are tested at both ends, refused just inside here
# and in REFUSED, the anniversary rule and proj_len()'s remainder rule at month 12, where
# each starts, and the first-term rule at month 1, its first, as at 71 and, on a one-year
# term, at 11, its last, and accepted just outside
# (test_the_edges_of_the_in_force_interface_are_accepted).  And each tolerance is pinned
# from both sides, refused just past it here or in REFUSED and accepted just inside it
# there (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §5.2, T5, precised at M10): the cents of the return-of-premium
# base, the anniversary rule and the remainder rule within two cents past, and the cent the
# first year's rules and the first term's hold the remainder, the base on either side of
# the premium and the two accounts to a tenth of a cent past, each read a part of a cent
# inside it.  Each case is read by a model of its own, its file named by a Reference set
# before the model computes anything (the malformed fixture), so a {file} in a message is
# the case's own filename.

    cover, ``t = proj_len()``, which the count's look-ahead reads, on a model that evaluates
    nothing else (:func:`_guard_faults`).  ``is_active``'s docstring promises that outside
    cover no cell reads a market path, a rate or a table at a key the contract does not
    have, so afterwards none of :data:`IN_COVER_ONLY` may hold a key outside cover.  Then
    every monthly cell, guarded or not, is called there, as Phase 2's full sweep will call
    it: each answers, with a Python value, but the scenario readers before issue, whose
    future copy holds no level there and which raise.  Every monthly cell is one of those
    lists, or :data:`EVERY_MONTH`'s, or takes more arguments than ``t``, so that a cell
    added to the model is placed in one.

    The committed table's one point issued after the valuation date is the anchor, a Cap
    Rate option of the portfolio family with no withdrawal, so on it a cell tied to another
    crediting method, family, programme or nge_reset would hold zero before issue, guarded
    or not.  So the same scan runs on the splice's future rows, the core's or, with
    ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``, all of them, with the splice's assumptions switched on: the Step
    option, the legacy family, nge_reset and the crash path among them, 13 months on, so
    that a read before issue lands at policy year 0 or lower.  Each row is made afresh
    first and released after.

    And after it no cell holds a month past ``proj_len()``: the Account Value carried out of
    a month and the count's residual read ``t + 1``, and are zero outside cover before they
    read it, so that the month after cover reads nothing past it, which a compiled model's
    cache would not hold (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md R1).

    Several of these guards change no number the frame shows: once the counts are zero
    outside cover, every cash flow is too, and an unguarded value multiplies a zero count.
    They are held here because they are what the docstrings promise a caller, and because
    Phase 2 needs them: a table read at a key the contract does not have would wrap round in

# These compile the model, once a session, into a temporary directory (conftest.sec_build),
# and run the compiled package in a child process only.  They skip without modelx-cython or
# a C compiler, and the cython CI job, which sets USLIB_REQUIRE_CYTHON=1, fails a skip.
# test_compiled_conventions.py checks the compiled model's types, its caches and its
# release, and compares it with modelx on the committed points; these hold what is RILA's
# own: the comparison on the splice grid, at the contract's extremes, where the caps bind
# and under the Holding Account's share and a NaN sent through a Reference, on labels that
# are not text, on keys written as floats and out of order and on keys far past every
# frame, the powers off their domain, the total's sign of zero, the refusals, the deepest
# call, a Reference set late and the runner.  Each comparison adds _rila_c4_also's calls,
# the codes and the keys no swept cell reaches.  None asks for sec_read, sec_model or
# s_model, which sweep every committed point; the grid test alone asks for spliced.

    On the anchor at issue age 0, issued now and 120 months on, whose cover runs 1,080
    months (:func:`_longest_cover`), each on a point of its own, a cold ``net_cf`` and a
    cold ``check_pols_roll_fwd_resid`` in the last month run the chains from the end of
    the cover back to ``t_entry()``, 1,100 levels deep in modelx on a model just read
    (:func:`test_the_deepest_cold_call_runs_one_cell_a_month`), the longest the contract
    allows.  Compiled they run on the C stack, which the interpreter's recursion limit
    does not count.  1 MiB is the stack MSVC gives an executable's main thread unless the
    executable asks for more: a host that embeds Python, where python.exe itself asks for
    2,000,000 bytes.  A thread whose stack is reserved at 1 MiB stands in for it on every
    platform (``sec_support.run_compiled``), and in one each call runs cold and returns
    modelx's number, identically on x86-64 (``sec_support.exact_here``) and to 1e-12
    elsewhere.  With MSVC 14.37, on the machine they were measured on, the calls ran on a
    reservation of 384 KiB and died on one of 320 (measured at M25).  Windows rounds a
    reservation up to 64 KiB, so the need lies between the two, and a finer step measures
    only the rounding: 2.7 to 3.2 times under 1 MiB.  From fixed reservations the chain
    takes about 287 bytes a level and 31 KiB besides, about 340 KiB (model-sec.md, *What a
    compiled run needs*).  gcc's need comes from the ``cython``
    job's Linux leg, whose warning records it, estimated at about twice MSVC's bytes a
    level, about 680 KiB, 1.5 times under 1 MiB.  A stack too small kills the child, and
    the test fails naming the stack.  The thread's stack is read back too, from Windows or
    from glibc, and must be at most 1 MiB and a page: a stand-in larger than asked for
    would stand for nothing.  And the calls run again on the child's main thread, which
    is what ``run_sec.py --cython`` runs on.

    The calls run first at each size of :data:`STACK_KIB`, before anything is asserted,
    and every size's outcome goes into a warning, which the job's summary shows, and into
    the failure, if there is one: the smallest size that ran bounds the stack the chain
    needs on the compiler at hand.  A size below the need kills its child on a stack
    overflow, by design.  Each bracketing child is waited for :data:`BRACKET_TIMEOUT`
    seconds and the two asserted runs :data:`ASSERTED_TIMEOUT`.
