"""House-style conventions every reference model in this library must satisfy.

Each model has its own test module asserting its product behaviour — the technical
notes' worked example, its recursions, its roll-forward identities. This module asserts
the things that are the *same* for all of them, parametrized over
:data:`conftest.MODELS`, so that the house style is enforced once rather than
re-litigated per model. A model registered in ``MODELS`` either conforms or fails here.

What the house style is, and why, is written up in ``products/term_life/model.md``:

* inputs are **external** CSVs beside ``run.py`` — the ``annuallife/TradLife_A`` layout,
  not ``basiclife/BasicTerm_S``'s embedded IOSpec — so the model folder holds nothing but
  formulas and a diff shows logic changes only;
* the CSV readers live in an unparameterized ``Data`` Space, so each file is read once
  per model rather than once per model point;
* every Space and every cells carries a docstring, and the ``Projection`` docstring
  carries the mapping from the technical notes' actuarial symbols to the cells names.

``Term_US_S`` also asserts several of these for itself, in more specific form (it names
its five input files and its own docstring phrases). That overlap is deliberate: the
checks here are the general contract, the ones there are that model's particulars.

This module also holds the library's **only** sweep of a model over its whole model point
table. Each product module used to run a second one on its own instance of the same model,
and a model point's first evaluation is by far the most expensive thing in this suite —
modelx caches per instance, so the second sweep pays full price to assert what the first
one just asserted. ``test_every_model_point_projects`` below is therefore where the
``check_*`` cells are called and where the few product assertions that did not generalise
live, in :data:`EXTRA_POINT_ASSERTIONS`.

The module serves two families (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md D10): the ``_S`` models, and the
``_SEC`` models derived from them, which run in force at ``t = 0`` and then compile.  Every
section but the last holds for both, and what differs between them is read from the
registry rather than assumed: the name suffix, the ``Projection`` parameter, the files
beside the model.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by hand.  The keys come from
:func:`us_registry.point_keys` and the ItemSpaces from :func:`us_registry.projection`, so a
model indexed by position (``idx``) is enumerated as correctly as one indexed by label.

The last section holds the conventions of the SEC family alone — the frame on the valuation
clock, the count timings, new business, the in-force columns, the twin identity with S,
and the registry's own consistency — parametrized over the SEC models registered.  Phase 1
registers them one product at a time, Term first.

def test_every_model_point_projects(name, model):
    """No model point may sit in the table that the input tables cannot serve.

    A model point the shipped rate tables cannot price raises deep inside a lookup, so
    without this the table quietly documents a capability the model does not have.

    This is the one place in the suite where a model is projected over its whole model point
    table, so it is also where the ``check_*`` cells are called — on every point rather than
    on the first alone — and where :data:`EXTRA_POINT_ASSERTIONS` is applied. ``notna``
    admits an infinity, so ``net_cf`` is checked for one separately; and every point must
    publish the same columns, or two rows of one model's output cannot be read together.

    Running the checks on every point rather than on the first found the one place in the
    library where a check does not close: :data:`CHECK_EXEMPTIONS` records it and why.

    The frame itself is asserted here for every point, because it is the same in every
    model. The time index ``t`` is 0-based: ``t = 0`` is the first period of a policy
    projected from issue (the issue year on an annual grid, the issue month on a monthly
    one), period ``t`` runs from time ``t`` to time ``t + 1``, and the attained age is
    ``age_at_entry + t`` on an annual grid (``age_at_entry + duration(t)``,
    ``duration(t) = t // 12``, on a monthly one). ``proj_len()`` is the number of
    periods from ``t = 0``, i.e. the exclusive end of the frame: ``result_cf()`` covers
    ``t = t_first, ..., proj_len() - 1``, where ``t_first`` is 0 for a point projected
    from issue and the elapsed periods for an in-force point (``WholeLife_US_S``'s
    ``proj_start()``). This is lifelib's own convention (``basiclife/BasicTerm_S``,
    ``savings/CashValue_SE``: ``for t in range(proj_len())``). A contractual policy year
    is the 1-based label ``t + 1`` (``duration(t) + 1`` on a monthly grid) and is
    derived, never indexed by.

    The SEC family amends that convention for itself (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md D3). There ``t``
    counts months from the valuation date, shared by every point however old the policy,
    the months a policy has been in force are ``duration_mth(t)``, and ``t_first`` is 0 for
    every point, which the SEC section at the end of this module asserts. Everything this
    test asserts holds under both conventions, so it runs unchanged over both families.

    every ``Projection[N]`` is a separate ItemSpace with its own cells cache. Readers placed
    there would re-read every file for every policy; in ``Data`` they are evaluated once
    per model.

    Two things make this safe to assert off the shared instance rather than off one built
    for the purpose. The sweep is repeated below, which costs nothing once
    ``test_every_model_point_projects`` has warmed this instance — and is what keeps the
    count complete when it has not, because ``-n`` can put the two tests in different
    workers. And the log is filtered to this model's own input directory, so the copies
    ``test_round_trip_is_stable`` re-reads out of ``tmp_path`` are not miscounted as second
    reads of the same file names.

    The expected file set comes from :data:`us_registry.INPUT_FILES` rather than from the
    log itself. Asserting only that whatever was read was read once is self-fulfilling: a
    file that stops being read drops out of the ``Counter`` instead of failing, and a
    shortened sweep passes with less coverage rather than louder.

    The filter is by directory, and an SEC model shares its directory with its S twin, so
    no other model may read from it while this window is open. That is why the twin
    identity reads its S model out of a copy (``twin_model``), and why
    ``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read`` reads its siblings without
    evaluating them. The twin identity also evaluates this model beyond the base sweep,
    and pytest 8 runs it before this test; it takes those reads back out of the log, so

# The SEC family — in force at t = 0, then compiled (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md)
#
# Everything above holds for every registered model. What follows holds for the SEC models
# alone (D10): what a model must meet once it takes points already in force at the
# valuation date, on the valuation clock, which no S model can. Each test is parametrized
# over SEC_MODELS, the models registered with a "twin".
#
# They reach their model through the same module-scoped ``name`` and ``model`` fixtures as
# the tests above, by parametrizing ``name`` indirectly at module scope; a fixture of their
# own would pay for a second cold sweep of every SEC point. Where pytest runs them depends
# on its version, and requirements.txt admits any from 8 (both orders were checked on a
# stand-in library). pytest 9.2 groups module-scoped parameters by value, so each test runs
# after its model's generic tests, on the instance their sweep has warmed. Every earlier
# release groups them by position in their parameter list, and an SEC model's position in
# SEC_MODELS is lower than its position in ALL, so there the section runs before its
# model's generic tests and pays the cold sweep itself, on an instance that is read again
# for those tests unless they follow at once. Each test gets the right model either way,
# because pytest compares the parameter itself before it reuses a fixture. Only the
# read-once window can tell the two orders apart, and only through T1, which evaluates the
# model beyond the base sweep; T1 takes those reads back out of the log (see there).

def test_new_business_twins_agree_with_s_cell_by_cell(name, model, twin_model, read_log):
    """T1, the twin identity: on new business the SEC model is its S model (§5.2).

    For every SEC row that is the ``"twin"`` of an S row and issued at ``t = 0``, where the
    two clocks coincide, every cell of the S model must agree with the SEC model's at every
    argument tuple the S cell cached inside its frame in the S model's own sweep, and an S
    cell the SEC model lacks fails. The cells whose meaning SEC changes by design are
    exempt: ``sec_support.TWIN_EXEMPT_DEFAULT``, and the product's own in
    ``sec_support.SEC_SPECS``, where a cell SEC drops is named too. Through this, every S
    worked example, its intermediate cells included, becomes an SEC assertion with no golden
    restated. At stage ``"EC"`` the SEC model spells S's timings and phases as int
    References named as S's strings (R9, R10), and ``sec_support.codes`` maps the one onto
    the other, in S's arguments and in S's values; an argument SEC takes otherwise, a
    total's code for S's ``None`` or a slot for S's month, goes through the spec's
    ``twin_arg_map`` first (R12, R15).

    The identity presumes what every S table in the library holds: each S point counts one
    policy. An SEC model charges per policy issued what its S model may charge once per
    model point, as Term's acquisition (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §7.1), and on a point counting
    any other number the two then differ by design, in cells no exemption can drop without
    dropping most of what is compared. A product whose S model does so says it in its
    ``SecSpec`` comment, and its module asserts the count.

    The twin of an S row already in force, on the policy clock (WholeLife, FIA) or the
    projection clock (UL's point 3), is not compared here. Its SEC frame starts at the
    valuation date, so it is a splice case, which the product module asserts (T2).

    Every cell is compared to 1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, so that an error in a
    count below 1e-9, which late in a long frame is most of what is in force, fails: but
    for :data:`TWIN_FLOORS`, the cells a product names with its floor and its reason.

    At least one pair must be compared. Every S table has new-business points, so an empty
    comparison means the twins have gone missing, and a check that compares nothing is how
    coverage disappears without a failure.

    The comparison evaluates the SEC model beyond its base sweep: at every argument tuple S
    cached, and ``sec_support.sweep`` reaches those through every ``result_*`` cells, not
    ``result_cf()`` alone. It does so inside ``read_log``'s window, whose reads
    ``test_inputs_are_read_once_not_once_per_model_point`` holds to
    :data:`us_registry.INPUT_FILES`, the base sweep's set, and it runs after that test or
    before it depending on the pytest version (see the section comment). A cell only T1
    reaches that reads an input would then fail the read-once test under one pytest and
    pass it under the other, which was shown on a stand-in. So this runs the base sweep
    first, which on a warm instance evaluates nothing, and then takes whatever the
    comparison read back out of the log, and the read-once test sees the same reads in
    either order.
