"""In-force tests for IUL_US_SEC: the splice, future business, counts, regeneration.

``IUL_US_SEC`` is ``IUL_US_S`` taught to run in force at a valuation date
(USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md, milestone M6).  It runs on two clocks: ``t`` counts months from the
valuation date, the same month for every model point, and ``duration_mth(t)`` counts the
months the policy has been in force, ``duration_mth_init() + t``.  A model point may be a
policy already in force at the valuation date, in any month of its policy year, one issued
at it, or one to be issued after it, as in ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SE``.  A policy in force
opens with the state its past has left it, per policy: its account value and its loan,
which are ``IUL_US_S``'s own columns, and six more, the fixed account and the loan
collateral apart from the loan, the face in force, the premiums paid to date, the no-lapse
guarantee's accumulator and the MEC latch; and its live index segments, each with its
balance, the deductions and draws charged to it, its index level at creation and the cap
declared then, in a companion of the model point table, ``inforce_segments_sec.csv``.

``IUL_US_S`` ships no point in force: its five points are new business, issued at its own
``t = 0``, where the two clocks coincide, and ``test_model_conventions.py`` asserts the
model is S there cell by cell (T1), which carries every golden of
``test_indexed_ul_us.py`` over, the worked example's engine cells and the anchor's months
among them.  The conventions also hold the SEC family's other rules: every frame opens at
``t = 0``, ``pols_if`` is the ``BEF_DECR`` count, ``BEF_DECR`` is ``BEF_NB`` plus the
month's new business, new business enters once, and nothing happens before issue.  This
module holds the rest of the plan's tests (its §5.2) and the product's own facts:

* T2, the splice: an S point restated in force at month ``d``, opened with the state S
  carries into ``d`` and the segments it holds live there, continues S's projection from
  ``d`` on, in every cell of S's, the four reports among them, the fixed account, the
  collateral and the account value at every timing, each segment's balance, deductions and
  draws, its credit, the loan, the face, the two premium accumulators and the counts.  The
  months straddle the product's events: a segment's creation and its maturity, the first
  anniversaries, the surrender charge's last month, the lapse shock year, the no-lapse
  guarantee failing, passing again and expiring, with its lapse shock on an exhausted
  account, the 7-pay test's seventh year and the MEC latch it leaves, the guideline cap on
  a target premium, a loan whose collateral is credited apart from it, charges ceasing in
  cover, a face withdrawn to nothing, a segment closing on a rounding about zero, and S
  point 5's fixed account and then its account value running below zero, the exhausted
  states ``IUL_US_S`` carries by design.  Fourteen variants of S's points, in a copy of
  S's table and each with input rows of its own, add every class and sex, both death
  benefit options, the single and the target premium, a premium mode of each kind, a
  second surrender charge schedule and none, issue ages 50 and 65, loans from the sixth
  year, withdrawals from the issue month and a split allocation; the twin of each variant
  issued at the valuation date is its S point in every cell, as a row issued there is.
  A second fixture, on References of its own, binds the bounds S ships idle, the index
  cap and the dynamic lapse multiplier's floor, under the guaranteed basis and the
  adjusted-beginning credit base; a formula override of the index path binds the index
  floor and the multiplier's cap; splices of their own move the segment term off its 12
  months and fail the 7-pay test first in its seventh policy year; and on a variant's twin
  ``seg_count`` and ``seg_share`` read a rounding about zero by S's tests of 0.
* T3, future new business: a point issued ``k`` months after the valuation date is S's
  projection ``k`` months on, with zeros before issue and no rate or table read there.
* D11's R1, R1a and R2, and D3 and D5's chains: on the splice's grid no cell is called at a
  negative month, none evaluated on the books reads a month before them, and none reads
  beyond ``t + 1``, the segment's creation balance followed to the sweep it reads; on the
  committed points no recursion runs backward over the frame, the policy clock is a closed
  form and no label accessor is read; and every chain of the model runs one cell a month
  from a cold start, as far as the contract's longest cover, the guarantee's expiry read
  after a lapsed guarantee bounded apart.
* T4, the count algebra: the count rolls forward through new business and decrements,
  ``result_pols`` is S's report with the new business beside it, and a count 2.5 times the
  table's, with every assumption that ships at zero switched on, scales every counted cell
  and moves no per-policy value.
* T5, validation: each malformed in-force row, and each malformed row of the segment
  ladder, is refused as the table is read, naming its point or its line, by one rule; each
  assumption table is refused, naming its file and the column, if a key is blank, text or
  fractional, with the lines it is on, or if the keys repeat or leave a gap, and so is one
  whose rates, factors or charges hold a value that is blank, text or infinite, or outside
  its range, while the bounds of each range are read; a text value no decode knows raises
  ``IUL_US_S``'s message, and a key no join finds names the point; the future horizon is a
  Reference that bounds future business; a point issued at or past the age the projection
  ends at, one at or past the end of the projection, one withdrawing less than its fee and
  one holding other than a ladder row for each live segment are refused by ``proj_len()``,
  each rule on its Reference, and read at it, just past it and with it moved, and two
  neighbouring rules broken together are refused by the first; a reader of the ladder asks
  ``proj_len()`` first; every state S reaches, restated in force, is accepted by ``Data``
  and ``proj_len()``, the exhausted accounts and a face of nothing among them, under the
  shipped References and each splice's; an extract with every amount carried to the cent
  is read and holds its checks; each flag reads the same in every spelling ``Data``
  accepts; and the edges of the interface are accepted, the tables' keys written as floats
  among them.
* T6, regeneration: the committed ``model_point_table_sec.csv`` and
  ``inforce_segments_sec.csv`` are what the generator makes of ``IUL_US_S`` and its table as
  they stand, and each derived and future row continues its S point from its month on.
* Then the two clocks on the shipped points, the values outside cover, the survivors the
  end of the projection carries, each opening column moving its chain, the index path on
  the valuation clock and the credits that stay S's, the cap a segment keeps from its
  creation and the fixed account's rate, each read at the valuation clock's month, the MEC
  latch, expense inflation, each check failing on a residual that is not a number and
  deciding as S's where its sides are small, a lapse rate past 1, which makes the checks
  raise, the margin identity once a loan exceeds the cash value, the worked example
  through this model's engine, the mortality cap and a NaN that reaches it, the corridor,
  the mortality and the COI tables read at their ends, the docstrings, the shared input
  tables and every Reference held to S's, those that ship equal to another set apart, what
  the default grid reaches, the block, an in-force extract and the runner.
* C2, the fingerprint: every committed point computes what the model computed when Phase 1
  ended, frozen at the end of this module before Phase 2 changed anything (§5.4).

SEC month ``t`` is S month ``t + source_mth`` throughout, the direction in which
``sec_support`` takes its ``t_offset``: ``d`` for a point restated at S month ``d``, 0 for
the twins of S's points, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months on.

**Roundings about zero.**  A segment, the pool of live segments or the fixed account can
close a month on a rounding about zero, a balance of the order of 1e-14 of either sign,
where a draw or a deduction took exactly what it held.  Off the valuation date each such
state is reached through other arithmetic than S's: the creation balance of a segment
carried in is its balance, deductions and draws summed, which is S's sweep only to
rounding, and each segment's return is a ratio of two levels on the valuation-clock path,
which is S's ratio only to its last bit.  So the comparisons hold every value to 1e-9
relative with no absolute floor (``ATOL``), but for a value both models give below
``FLOOR``, 1e-9, per policy, which is held to that floor, a count-weighted value to the
floor times the count in force, and for ``seg_count`` and ``seg_share``, which read such a
value by ``IUL_US_S``'s own tests of zero, in a month where a live segment or the pool is a
nonzero rounding below the floor in either model (:func:`_rounding_map`).  A count is never
floored.

**The core grid and the full one** (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6).  An IUL projection runs up to 912
months on the grid, and T2 and T3 over every case would take this module far past three
minutes in every run.  By default they run a core, chosen by the lines of the model each row
runs, so that between them they reach every line, every opening-state column, every kind of
valuation month and every premium pattern and mode the full grid reaches, which
``test_the_core_grid_reaches_every_branch`` asserts, each bound by the raw value it bounds
and each side of every ``min`` and ``max`` by the values it compares, and which holds,
besides, the row on which each fault the build's and M13's sweeps recorded was first caught.
The splice's three comparisons are parametrized by S point at class scope (``_held``), so
that pytest runs every case of one S point together and ``_swept`` sweeps each S point once
a run, not once for each test that compares one of its rows.  The core does not make the
module short: its default run took 912 seconds under load at M13, the longest of
the product modules, where it took 936 to 955 at M6 (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6, weighed at M13).
The other cases, the rules test's scan of their rows, the second fixture's other rows, the
every-state test's months between the windows' edges and its run under the main splice's
References, the depth test's cold calls but the deepest and its ascending sweeps at the
contract's longest cover, the splice at a segment term of 24 months, the References set
apart on S's twins, the index path's override, the flag spellings, the block and the
runner's test on the committed table carry the ``sec_full`` marker and are skipped, with the
reason shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set.  Each was moved only where every fault the
sweeps recorded keeps a catcher in the default run.  They are never dropped: one leg of the
CI matrix sets it, and ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1 python -m pytest -m sec_full
tests/test_indexed_ul_us_sec.py`` runs them alone.  Memory is the other cost: a projected
point holds tens of megabytes of cached values and their dependency graph, so a row read
once is released as soon as it has been read (``_release``), the splice's rows are held one
at a time, and so are the splice's S points: the generator builds a splice's rows one S
point at a time, and each comparison sweeps the one S point it needs (``_swept``).  Each
splice's two models are fixtures of the class that holds every test reading them, so they
are closed before the committed model and S are first read, and the tests that read models
of their own run next, before those are first read, so that none of the models they read
sits in memory beside them (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §7.7, *Record — M9*, *Memory*).

Every test keeps five rules.  Each model is read under a name of its own and closed:
``test_indexed_ul_us.py`` reads S under its default name, and reading a model under a name
in use renames the open one.  Every Reference a test sets, ``Data``'s included, is set on a
model just read, before anything is computed: a compiled model never clears a cache.  No
test writes inside the library tree: every changed input goes through
``sec_support.temp_inputs`` into a temporary directory, because a CSV added beside the
models, even briefly, would fail a concurrent
``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read``.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by
hand: the keys come from ``us_registry.point_keys`` and the ItemSpaces from
``us_registry.projection``, and a generated row is found by what it is, its kind, its S
policy and its month (``_row``), so neither a renumbered table nor Phase 2's positions can
point a test at the wrong row.  The one exception is a table ``Data`` refuses, which has
no keys to give: it is read through the base ``Projection``'s default point.  And a timing
or a kind is passed through ``_code``, which gives the model's Reference of that name where
the model defines one and the string otherwise, and every cell-by-cell comparison goes
through ``_twin``: Phase 2 changes the call syntax only (C1), each in one place.

#     of the cessation; it ships at 121, equal to maturity_age, which a rewritten cell
#     reading the one for the other would hide;
#   lapse_rate_cap at 0.35 and lapse_shock_mult at 10.0: the cap, shipped at 1.0, binds in
#     the lapse shock year, the base rate's 4% times 10 against 35%; each ships equal to
#     another Reference a rewritten cell reads, the cap to index_par, the multiplier to

#   expense_unit_mth_2 at 0.05: the per-unit charge from policy year 11, which ships at 0,

#     takes past 1.
# inflation_rate stays at its shipped 0, as does the second fixture's: IUL_US_S ships
# inflation at 0 and no improvement, so restated rows are S frame by frame, and a test of

    Every bound binds, with an effect, on a row the default run compares with S cell by

    bounded output (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §7.6, *Record — M4*, *Every bound binds*, precised
    at M9).  So, while a splice case is swept and compared, ``builtins.min`` and ``max``
    are wrapped (:meth:`watch`): a call made from one of the model's formulas with two
    arguments or more, not all equal, records each argument equal to its result as a side
    that won, ``(cell, call, i)``, the cell, the call's text with its comments dropped and
    its spaces collapsed, and the argument's position.  Every other call passes straight
    through.  The sides are the formulas' own calls, found in their source
    (:attr:`sides`), but those in the message a ``raise`` builds, which bound nothing; a
    call is told apart by its position in its formula's code, which Python gives from
    3.11, and before it :meth:`watch` records nothing.  It is ``VA_US_SEC``'s module's
    record, as that module keeps it.

        This is the test that says the opening state is complete: a state column the SEC
        row did not carry, or carried from the wrong instant, or a segment of the ladder
        read from the wrong slot, would make SEC part from S here, and nowhere else,
        because on a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and the opening
        state is zero.  The fixed account and the collateral open from their own columns,
        apart from the account value and the loan, which open from S's; the face, the
        premiums paid, the no-lapse accumulator and the MEC latch from theirs; and each live
        segment from its row of the ladder, its balance, its deductions and draws, its
        start level and its cap, so that each segment carried in matures with S's credit.
        For the same reason it is the test that catches a policy month passed as ``t``
        (R1a): the rows valued mid-year put the segments' maturities, the anniversary
        premium and the policy-year steps off the valuation years.  The frame comparisons
        read SEC row ``t`` against S row ``t + d`` in every column of the four reports both
        models hold but ``result_seg``'s ``index_level``, which runs on the valuation clock,
        and fail frames that end apart.  The cell comparison then evaluates every cell of
        S's but :data:`SPLICE_EXEMPT`, at every argument S cached inside its own frame from
        month ``d`` on, moved onto SEC's clock: the accounts at every timing, the segment
        cells at every policy month of creation, the loan, the counts, the four checks'
        verdicts and the engine cells; and the MEC latch against S's 7-pay test failed in
        any month before (:func:`_latch_faults`).  An S cell this model lacked would fail
        it.

        Every value is held to 1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, because near the end
        of a long frame the counts fall far below 1e-7, where the floor would compare them
        against nothing, but S's roundings about zero, each held to its floor, and the two
        tests of zero that read one (:func:`_rounding_map`).  ``IUL_US_S`` has no residual
        cell, its checks being bools, so no compared cell is a residual rounding around 0
        that keeps the floor; this model's residual cells are held through the checks,
        which are compared as bools.

        the segment cells at every segment live, as Phase 2's sweep
        (:func:`_sweep_on_the_books`), so that a read no report makes is judged too:

        * R1: no cell holds a negative argument, a month, a policy month of creation, an
          attained age, a policy year or a slot of the ladder.  modelx evaluates one without
          complaint, and a compiled cache raises ``IndexError`` below 0
          (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md F4).
        * R1's look-back stops at ``t_entry()``: no cell evaluated at a month from
          ``t_entry()`` on read a month before it.  On a point issued later a chain based
          at ``t == 0``, as ``IUL_US_S``'s accounts, segments, loan, face, accumulators and
          count all were, reads the pre-issue zeros, so no number shows it and no argument
          goes negative.  This is the test that holds those bases at ``t_entry()`` (R1a).
          IUL has no improvement and reads no input a year back, so no look-back is
          admitted.
        * R2's look-ahead: no cell evaluated at month ``t`` read a cell keyed by a month
          beyond ``t + 1``, as modelx's dependency graph records each cached call's
          precedents.  IUL reads nothing at the anniversary ahead, so R2's one exception
          has no use here.
        * The premise of the two scans: no cell without a ``t`` but the loops over the
          frame reads one keyed by ``t``, so a read through a cell keyed by an attained age,
          a policy year or a slot is a read of the month that asked, but
          :data:`FOLLOWED`'s, ``seg_new_pp(m)``, which reads the sweep of a segment's
          creation month, and which the scan follows to that read and judges against the
          month of the call that asked, on the core's rows at least once.
        * No projection call reads S's ``None`` default for an engine cell's cap or
          convention, which reads the cap at the literal month 0, and none reads
          ``seg_matured_value``: the projection passes each segment's cap and the convention
          explicitly (R14).

        Each row was scanned by the case that compared it, before the comparison
        (:func:`_scanned`), and a row no case has scanned is scanned here.  The core case
        covers the core's rows, the full case every other row of the full grid, with
        ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``.  The twins of S's own new business in the splice's table are

# (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §7.11, Switches and bounds S ships idle): the guaranteed basis, whose
# cap of 2% binds every segment's credit, and a multiplier's floor of 1.2, which binds in
# every month, set strictly apart from the cap of 2.0 and the neutral 1.0.  The same
# References switch on the two switches IUL_US_S ships off, the guaranteed basis and the
# adjusted-beginning credit base, which half-weights a segment's deductions, so T1 runs
# under them on S's five twins: under the base a segment carried in reads its deductions
# from the ladder into its credit, which under the remaining balance they leave.  The other
# sides, the index floor and the multiplier's cap, take the index path overridden in both

      each while every other is cold.  No IUL point lapses for insufficiency, so every
      count runs its whole chain.
    * ``expiry``: the twin of S's point 5, whose guarantee holds last in month 48, read in
      ascending ``t`` to its expiry's first month, 240, as a report reads it; the account
      value was read at no month from 49 to 239, and the count of month 241 then runs the
      account value's chain cold from 240 back to 49, 192 months, the deepest read an
      ascending sweep makes, within :data:`EXPIRY_OVERHEAD` beyond it (:func:`_expiry_gap`).

      below, ``net_cf`` in its last month, 1,451 months above ``t_entry()``, the deepest
      call a projection makes on the longest chain the contract allows, both rows' frames

#
# Each malformed table is the committed one with one fault.  The checks run over the whole
# table as it is read, in Data, and the message names the file it read and the column or
# every point at fault.  A blank cell reads as NaN, and so does a text cell once the checks
# coerce the column to numbers, so each is refused as a count, a duration, an age, a year,
# an amount, a share or a balance that is not a number, and a share past 1 as well as
# below 0.  The repeated point_id holds another policy under the same label, as a bad
# extract would, so that the check must look at the labels and not at whole rows.  The
# point_ids are the committed table's: 1 to 5, S's five points, issued at the valuation
# date; 6, S point 1 at 60; 7, S point 4 at 65, its twelve segments carried in; 8, S point
# 5 at 6; 9, S point 5 at 384, its fixed account below 0, with a loan and its collateral;
# 10, S point 5 at 605, its account value below 0 too; 11, S point 1 at 888; 12, S point 4
# issued 25 months on.  Each case is refused by its own rule alone, or, where a case pins
# a rule's place, by its rule first, on a row a later rule would refuse differently: a
# fractional duration on the future row past the horizon, which the horizon would refuse;
# a collateral below 0 on a row not yet in force, which the rule that holds the state there
# at 0 would refuse; and a blank fixed account on a row in force, which the segment
# ladder's identity would refuse.  A flag is True or False in any case, as pandas reads
# those words, and nothing else: the life chassis keeps S's bool(), which reads "0" or
# "0.0" in a column made text by one such cell as true, so 1, 0, 1.0 and 0.0 are refused,
# as a blank and any other text are (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §7.8, Record — M10, Flag
# spellings); a TRUE beside the bad cell, which the column's text keeps as written, is
# still a flag, so the message names the bad cell's point alone; and the spellings
# accepted are read in a test of their own.  Each rule over a window of policy months is
# refused at the window's first month and its last (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md §5.2, T5, precised
# at M10): the state of a policy not yet in force at months 0 and -120, the horizon; the
# face in force at months 1 and 911, the last of cover; and the 7-pay test at months 1
# and 84.  The edges test reads the state at month 1 and the 7-pay test at month 85 and on
# its limit, just outside; the face has no month outside its window that the state's rule
# or proj_len() does not refuse first.

    half, and each segment held to ``-1e-8`` or more.  The committed table with its seven
    amounts (:data:`MONEY`) and the ladder with its three (:data:`LADDER_MONEY`) rounded to
    the cent are read by ``Data``, every row passes ``proj_len()``, and each holds its four
    checks, as each committed point does: the account value opens from its parts, so the
    carried roundings open one account and ``check_av_components`` holds, and a segment
    closed on a rounding about zero is carried as 0.  Each row projects within a cent a
    policy of its committed row, the committed model's, swept, in every month's net cash
    flow, and the row of S point 4 at 65, whose twelve segments carry the most roundings,
    opens its account value off the column it carries, which ``Data`` admits within its
    slack.
