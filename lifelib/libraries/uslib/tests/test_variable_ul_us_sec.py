"""In-force tests for VUL_US_SEC: the splice, future business, counts, regeneration.

``VUL_US_SEC`` is ``VUL_US_S`` taught to run in force at a valuation date
(USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md, milestone M4).  It runs on two clocks: ``t`` counts months from the
valuation date, the same month for every model point, and ``duration_mth(t)`` counts the
months the policy has been in force, ``duration_mth_init() + t``.  A model point may be a
policy already in force at the valuation date, in any month of its policy year, one issued
at it, or one to be issued after it, as in ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SE``.  A policy in force
opens with the state its past has left it, per policy: each subaccount's value, the fixed
option's and the debt, which are ``VUL_US_S``'s own columns, and two more, the loan
account's collateral and the face in force.

The worked example is not restated here.  ``VUL_US_S`` counts its months from the start of
its own projection, and opens its points 1 and 2, in force 24 months, and 4, in force 120,
at its own ``t = 0``, so the twins of those three points open at offset 0 and are splice
cases (T2): each is S's point in every cell of S's, at no tolerance beyond the relative
1e-9, which carries every golden of ``test_variable_ul_us.py`` on them over, the worked
example's month, asserted at ``t = 0`` on point 1, among them.  S's point 3 is new
business, issued at the valuation date, where the two clocks coincide, and
``test_model_conventions.py`` asserts the model is S there cell by cell (T1).  The
conventions also hold the SEC family's other rules: every frame opens at ``t = 0``,
``pols_if`` is the ``BEF_DECR`` count, ``BEF_DECR`` is ``BEF_NB`` plus the month's new
business, new business enters once, and nothing happens before issue.  This module holds
the rest of the plan's tests (its §5.2) and the product's own facts:

* T2, the splice: an S point restated in force at month ``d``, opened with the state S
  carries into ``d``, continues S's projection from ``d`` on, in every cell of S's, the
  four reports among them, its subaccounts, fixed option, loan account, debt and face
  at every timing, and the pricing path behind the funding ratio, at S's own policy
  months.  The months straddle the product's events: the first anniversaries, the loan's
  preferred tier, the lapse table's last year, the surrender charge's cliff and its
  one-month lapse spike, the month a shortfall begins, the attained age at which the
  splice's charges cease, the corridor's first binding month and the last covered month.
  Nine variants of S's points, in a copy of S's table and each with input rows of its own,
  add withdrawals on either death benefit option, a single premium with no surrender
  charge, an Option B point funded past its face, a point on a second surrender-charge
  schedule with a loan, an issue age below the tables' first age, each first-month pin
  alone, the COI pin above the guaranteed rate that bounds it, and a withdrawal that cuts
  the face past 0, and between them every sex and every class.  Each row reads the return
  scenario re-based to its own month.
* T3, future new business: a point issued ``k`` months after the valuation date is S's
  projection ``k`` months on, with zeros before issue and no rate, table or return read
  there.
* D11's R1, R1a and R2, and D3 and D5's chains: on the splice's grid no cell is called at a
  negative month, none evaluated on the books reads a month before them, none reads
  beyond ``t + 1``, and the pricing path, keyed by the policy month from issue, reads
  nothing on the valuation clock; on the committed points no recursion runs backward over
  the frame, the policy clock is a closed form and no label accessor is read; and every
  chain of the model runs one cell a month from a cold start, as far as the contract's
  longest cover.
* T4, the count algebra: the count rolls forward through new business and decrements,
  ``result_pols`` is S's report with the new business beside it, and a count 2.5 times the
  table's, with every assumption that ships at zero switched on, scales every counted cell
  and moves no per-policy value.
* T5, validation: each malformed in-force row is refused as the table is read, naming its
  point, by one rule; each assumption table is refused, naming its file and the column,
  if a key is blank, text or fractional, with the lines it is on, or if the keys repeat or
  leave a gap, with each key that repeats, its lines, and each that is missing; so is one
  whose rates, class factors, surrender charges, fund expenses or returns hold a value
  that is blank, text or infinite, a lapse or mortality rate outside 0 to 1, a class
  factor, a COI rate, a fund expense, a premium persistency factor or a surrender charge
  below 0, and a run-off that is not a whole number of years, 1 or more, while the bounds
  of each range are read; a text value no decode knows raises ``VUL_US_S``'s message; the
  future horizon is a Reference that bounds future business, and at 0 refuses it; a point
  at or past the end of the projection is refused by ``proj_len()``; the edges of the
  interface are accepted, the tables' keys written as floats among them, each rule over a
  window of policy months refused just inside each end and read just outside; and every
  state ``VUL_US_S`` reaches, restated in force under each set of References on which
  those states differ, is accepted, but an account below 0, refused by name.
* T6, regeneration: the committed ``model_point_table_sec.csv`` is what the generator makes
  of ``VUL_US_S`` and its table as they stand, and each of its derived and future rows
  projects its S point's numbers from its month on.
* Then the two clocks on the shipped points, S's in-force points as their twins, the
  values outside cover, the survivors the end of the projection carries, the face, the
  collateral and each subaccount opening from their own columns, the return scenario,
  expense inflation and the declared rate on the valuation clock and the pricing path
  off it, the COI rate's bound by the guaranteed rate and the declared rate's floor where
  they bind, a check whose residual is not a number, a lapse rate past 1, which makes
  every check raise, each check deciding as S's where its sides are small, the margin
  identity once a loan exceeds the cash value, acquisition on new business, the
  mortality cap and a NaN that reaches it or a bound on the COI rate, the docstrings, the
  shared input tables, what the default grid reaches, the block, an in-force extract and
  the runner.
* C2, the fingerprint: every committed point computes what the model computed when Phase 1
  ended, frozen at the end of this module before Phase 2 changed anything (§5.4).

SEC month ``t`` is S month ``t + source_mth`` throughout, the direction in which
``sec_support`` takes its ``t_offset``: ``d`` for a point restated at S month ``d``, 0 for
the twins of S's points, in force or not, ``-k`` for one issued ``k`` months on.

**The core grid and the full one** (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md K6).  A VUL projection runs up to
1,344 months on the grid, and T2 and T3 over every case, 48 restated rows, six in-force
twins and 9 future points, would take this module far past three minutes in every run.
By default they run a core of 17 and 5 cases, chosen so that between them they reach
every branch, every opening-state column, every kind of valuation month and every premium
pattern the full grid reaches, which ``test_the_core_grid_reaches_every_branch`` asserts.
VUL premiums are annual amounts paid monthly, the one mode the product models, so there is
no mode to reach.  The other cases, the rules test's scan of their rows and the depth
test's run with the behaviour module on at the longest cover carry the ``sec_full``
marker and are skipped, with the reason shown, unless ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1`` is set.  They
are never dropped: one leg of the CI matrix sets it, so every CI run runs the full grid,
and ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1 python -m pytest -m sec_full tests/test_variable_ul_us_sec.py``
runs them alone.  Memory is the other cost: a projected point holds tens of megabytes of
cached values and their dependency graph, so a row read once, a splice case's or a point
of a temporary copy, is released as soon as it has been read (``_release``), and the
splice's rows are held one at a time, however large the grid.  And the splice's two models
are fixtures of the class that holds every test reading them, so they are closed before
the committed model and S are first read, and the module never holds both.

Every test keeps five rules.  Each model is read under a name of its own and closed:
``test_variable_ul_us.py`` reads S under its default name, and reading a model under a
name in use renames the open one.  Every Reference a test sets, ``Data``'s included, is
set on a model just read, before anything is computed: a compiled model never clears a
cache.  No test writes inside the library tree: every changed input goes through
``sec_support.temp_inputs`` into a temporary directory, because a CSV added beside the
models, even briefly, would fail a concurrent
``test_every_csv_beside_the_model_is_actually_read``.  No test indexes ``Projection`` by
hand: the keys come from ``us_registry.point_keys`` and the ItemSpaces from
``us_registry.projection``, and a generated row is found by what it is, its kind, its S
policy and its month (``_row``), so neither a renumbered table nor Phase 2's positions can
point a test at the wrong row.  The one exception is a table ``Data`` refuses, which has
no keys to give: it is read through the base ``Projection``'s default point.  And a timing
or a kind is passed through ``_code``, which gives the model's Reference of that name
where the model defines one and the string otherwise, and every cell-by-cell comparison
goes through ``_twin``: Phase 2 changes the call syntax only (C1), each in one place.

# 5, withdrawals of $100 a month on Option B, F PNT: the face never moves, and its

# 6, the same withdrawals on Option A, M PPlusNT: each cuts the face in proportion to the

#   lapse spike has no cliff to fall at;
# 8, LEVEL at $60,000 a year on Option B, M PTob: the account value outgrows the face, and
#   the corridor binds on Option B;
# 9, S's in-force point 4 in force at 60 months, M StdTob, on VUL10, a second schedule of
#   $12.00 per $1,000 run off over 10 years: its loan steps to the preferred rate at S
#   month 48, policy year 10, and its lapse spike falls at S month 60, policy month 120;
#   S opens it at its own t = 0, so its twin is a splice case too;
# 10, issue age 10, below the mortality and corridor tables' first age, 18, which both
#   models read at 18: its own COI rows, the longest cover the grid runs, 1,344 months,
#   and a guaranteed COI scale steep enough to reach the cap of $83.34 before charges
#   cease, so that the cap moves the current rate and the charge;
# 11, S's point 2 with a COI pin alone, $0.50, above its guaranteed rate in policy year 3,
#   $0.259467, which bounds it: the pin applied at t = 0 without the corridor's, and the
#   bound on it binding; S opens it at its own t = 0, so its twin is a splice case;
# 12, S's point 2 with a corridor pin alone, the worked example's 2.15: the corridor's pin
#   without the COI rate's, so that neither pin's flag stands in for the other's;
# 13, S's point 3 on Option A, paying $1,200 a year and withdrawing $100 a month: in its
#   issue month the withdrawal is more than the 96.00 of account value its first net
#   premium buys, so the proportionate cut is 500,000 x 100 / 96, more than the face, and

#     reads;
#   lapse_shock_mult at 3, where the shipped 1 makes the spike at the surrender charge's
#     cliff change nothing; VUL's lapse rate has no cap, so no cap needs a shock to meet it;
#   expense_acq at $250, which ships at 0, so that acquisition on future business shows;
#   mort_ae_factor at 0.56, which leaves lives at the end of every frame, so that the
#     survivors carried into t = proj_len(), which S's roll-forwards read there, are
#     compared on every row, and which keeps every class's annual rate below 1, StdTob's
#     oldest at 1.75 x 0.56 = 0.98: at an A/E of 1 its product passes 1 at attained age
#     113, where both models cap it (the mortality cap test);
#   charges_cease_age at 100, inside every frame, where the shipped 121 is the frame's last
#     age: premiums, withdrawals and monthly deductions cease in cover;
#   crediting_rate_curr at 2.5%, the declared fixed rate set apart from the guaranteed 1%,
#     equal as shipped, so that a max that read the wrong one would show, and from the
#     loan account's 1%.
# Expense inflation ships at 0, and stays there: it runs on the two clocks by design, and

        This is the test that says the opening state is complete: a state column the SEC
        row did not carry, or carried from the wrong instant, would make SEC part from S
        here, and nowhere else, because on a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks
        coincide and the opening state is zero.  Each subaccount and the fixed option open
        from their own columns, never the allocation of the account value, the loan
        account from its own, apart from the debt once interest has accrued, and the face
        from the face in force.  For the same reason it is the test that catches a policy
        month passed as ``t`` (R1a), a look-back that stops at the wrong month, a pin
        applied in the wrong month, and a return read on the wrong clock: each row reads
        its S scenario re-based to its own month, and the scenarios move every month.
        The frame comparisons read SEC row ``t`` against S row ``t + d`` in every column of
        the four reports both models hold, and fail frames that end apart.  The cell
        comparison then evaluates every cell of S's but :data:`SPLICE_EXEMPT`, at every
        argument S cached inside its own frame from month ``d`` on, moved onto SEC's
        clock: the accounts at every timing, the debt, the face, the counts, the checks,
        and the pricing path at S's own keys, policy months from issue, which are the same
        months on both models.  An S cell this model lacked would fail it.  The first

        S's own in-force points, opened at its ``t = 0``, are cases too, at offset 0, and

        value is held to 1e-9 relative with no absolute floor, because near the end of a
        long frame the counts fall far below 1e-7, to 2.8e-14 on variant 9, where the floor
        would compare them against nothing.  ``VUL_US_S`` has no residual cell, its checks
        being bools, so no compared cell is a residual rounding around 0 that keeps the
        floor; this model's three residual cells are held through the checks, which are

        Each is a rule of how the model computes, not of what, so no number shows a
        breach, and on a point issued at ``t = 0`` the two clocks coincide and hide it from
        T1 too.  The splice's rows are points in force at every month T2 names, the variants
        among them, and points issued later, each with the behaviour module on, which reads
        the pricing path; and each is run on the books first, its four reports, its checks
        and every monthly cell at every month on the books, as Phase 2's sweep
        (:func:`_sweep_on_the_books`), so that a read no report makes is judged too:

        * R1: no cell holds a negative argument, a month, a policy month, a policy year or
          an age.  modelx evaluates one without complaint, and a compiled cache raises
          ``IndexError`` below 0 (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md F4).  The pricing path's policy months
          among them: a funding ratio asked before issue would ask it for a negative one.
        * R1's look-back stops at ``t_entry()``: no cell evaluated at a month from
          ``t_entry()`` on read a month before it.  On a point issued later a chain based at
          ``t == 0``, as ``VUL_US_S``'s subaccounts, fixed option, loan account, debt, face
          and count all were, and the account value's opening balance, reads the pre-issue
          zeros, so no number shows it and no argument goes negative.  This is the test
          that holds those bases at ``t_entry()`` (R1a).  No report reads the account
          value's opening balance in the issue month, where the funding ratio returns
          before it, so the checks and the sweep are what reach that base.  The pricing
          path is the one look-back allowed: a projection made at issue, based at issue on
          purpose (:func:`_rule_breaches`).
        * R2's look-ahead: no cell evaluated at month ``t`` read a cell keyed by a month
          beyond ``t + 1``, nor the pricing path at a policy month beyond the one ``t + 1``
          is, as modelx's dependency graph records each cached call's precedents.  VUL has
          no read further ahead, so R2's one exception has no use here.
        * The premise of the two scans: no cell without a ``t`` but the loops over the frame
          reads one keyed by ``t``, so a read through a cell keyed by a policy month, a
          policy year, an age or a subaccount is a read of the month that asked, and the
          pricing path reads nothing on the valuation clock.

        Each row was scanned by the T2 or T3 case that compared it, before the comparison
        (:func:`_scanned`), and a row no case has scanned is scanned here.  The core case
        covers the core's rows, the full case every other row of the full grid, with
        ``USLIB_SEC_FULL=1``.  The new-business twins in the splice's table are no case's,
        and are left out: on them the clocks coincide, and T1 compares them with S cell by
        cell.  The closed-form clock and the recursion depth are asserted on the committed

        The default run thins the splice to a core (the module docstring), and this test is

        with the variants, each property below holds of some core case: each death benefit
        option, each premium pattern, withdrawals on either option, a loan, a fixed option,

        on an anniversary, the month before the lapse spike and the spike's own month, in
        shortfall, and the last covered month.  The core is chosen by the lines it covers,
        and a branch that differs only in the month it fires covers no line of its own: a
        spike skipped in the first month on the books passed every core row until one was
        valued in its spike month.  And of some core future case: issued off the valuation
        anniversaries and on them, more than a year on, with withdrawals, a single premium
        and no surrender charge.  VUL premiums are annual amounts paid monthly, the one mode
        the product models, so no mode is asked for.

        Then, on the splice's model, of some core row, each of :data:`AT_VALUATION` and
        :data:`IN_FRAME`, what no column of the table shows: every opening-state column in
        use, the face in force below the face at issue and cut at ``t = 0``, the collateral
        apart from the loan, each pin applied at ``t = 0``, each pin alone, so that
        neither's flag can stand in for the other's, the COI pin above the guaranteed rate
        that bounds it, the shortfall at ``t = 0`` and survivors carried into
        ``t = proj_len()``; and
        later in the frame the corridor on either option, the lapse spike, charges ceased in
        cover, the funding ratio and the pricing path at or below 0, each bound of the
        dynamic lapse multiplier and of the premium persistency adjustment passed, the
        deduction's and the withdrawal's fallback shares, a subaccount below 0, the loan's
        preferred tier stepping in, the COI cap binding where it moves the charge, a table
        read below its first age, a COI scale read past its last year, a face cut past 0
        before its floor, a withdrawal and the single premium collected.  The two bounds
        no splice reference can bind, the guaranteed rate over a current scale above it and
        the declared rate's floor, are asserted, against ``VUL_US_S``, by

      the twin of S's point 1, in force 24 months, is 524 and evaluates ``duration_mth``
      once, where ``BasicTerm_SE``'s recursion would evaluate it at all 501 months from 0.
    * R2's recursions run forward: under modelx's recursion limit lowered to
      :data:`CALL_DEPTH`, every committed point is swept, each column in ascending ``t``.
      A forward recursion, through ``t - 1``, finds the month before already cached and
      stays shallow, which is why D3 is asserted on its own.  A backward recursion over the
      frame, through ``t + 1``, keeps every step within the look-ahead but opens a chain as
      long as the frame, which a compiled model would run on the C stack (F7), and fails
      here.
    * No projection cell reads a label accessor (``sex``, ``rate_class``, ``db_option``,
      ``qual_test``, ``premium_type``, ``surr_charge_id``, ``scenario_id``): once every
      point is swept, none holds a key.  The decodes and the per-point joins read
      ``model_point()``, and the accessors are kept for reporting, as Phase 2 declares
      them (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md R17).

    months after point 4 and its row issued 25 months on, each withdrawing $100 a month,
    the second with every count :data:`COUNT_FACTOR` times the first's, are read with
    :data:`SWITCHED_ON` set first: every assumption that ships at zero or off switched on,
    so that every flow is nonzero on some point, acquisition on new business, the behaviour
    module, inflation, the loan's spread and the collateral, the pins and the withdrawals
    and their fees among them; every row pays a level premium.  A factor that is not whole
    sees a count truncated to whole policies, and a flow left at zero sees no count at all.
    Point by point, each released once compared:

    * every counted column of the four reports is 2.5 times the first's, to 1e-12 relative,
      value by value, a difference of products (``net_cf``, ``net_cf_ga``) to 1e-12 of its
      peak;
    * every cell of :data:`COUNTED` at every key the first's sweep cached is 2.5 times the
      first's, value by value (:func:`_scaled_faults`);
    * ``result_pols``' rates, ``result_net``'s net amount at risk and the whole of
      ``result_av``, the account value roll-forward per policy, are the first's exactly;
    * every other cell is the first's exactly, at every key, but the three residuals, which
      are relative and move in the last digits; and the three checks hold on both;

    and every cell of :data:`COUNTED` but ``pols_maturity`` is nonzero on some point.

# Each malformed table is the committed one with one fault.  The checks run over the whole
# table as it is read, in Data, and the message names the file it read and the column or
# every point at fault.  A blank cell reads as NaN, and so does a text cell once the checks
# coerce the column to numbers, so each is refused as a count, a duration, an amount, a
# share or a balance that is not a number, and a share, the premium load or an allocation,
# past 1 as well as below 0.  The repeated point_id holds another policy under the same
# label, as a bad extract would, so that the check must look at the labels and not at whole
# rows.  The point_ids are the committed table's: 1 and 2, S's points in force at 24, 1
# with its pins; 3, S's new business; 4, S's point in force at 120 with a loan; 5, S point
# 3 at 12; 6, S point 4 six months on, at 126, its collateral and its loan parted; 7, S
# point 3 at 593; 8, S point 4 at 888; 9, issued 25 months on.  Each case is refused by
# its own rule alone, or, where a case pins a rule's place, by its rule first, on a row a
# later rule would refuse differently: a fractional duration on the future row, which the
# horizon would refuse; a blank face at issue on a row in force, which the face-at-most
# rule would; a negative or text collateral or loan, or one on a row not yet in force,
# beside the rule that pairs the two; a negative, infinite or text face in force, which
# the in-force face rules would read as written; and a negative pin on the future row.  A
# rule over a window of policy months is refused just inside each end of it (§5.2, T5,
# precised at M10): an opening state on a point not yet in force at the horizon, -120, as
# well as at 0 and -25, where that window's last month is 0; a face in force of 0, or above
# the face at issue, a month in force, the first month of the in-force rules' window; and
# a pin on a point issued a month after the valuation date and at the horizon, the ends of
# its window, as well as at -25.  The edges test accepts each just outside its window,
# where a state can be: an opening state a month in force, and a pin on a point issued at
# the valuation date.  A {file} in a message is the table's filename: every case is read
# from a file of its own (the malformed fixture).

    """``t`` counts from the valuation date; ``duration_mth(t)`` from issue (D3, D4).

    On the twin of S's new business the two coincide, its policies enter as new business
    at ``t = 0``, and its frame is 924 months, the projection's end at attained age 122.
    S's point 1 is in policy year 3 at attained age 47 at ``t = 0``, with 900 months left,
    and its first-month pins apply in the valuation month alone, the worked example's: the
    corridor factor is the pinned 2.15 at ``t = 0`` and the rule's 2.03 at 47 from
    ``t = 1``, and the current COI rate the pinned $0.04 at ``t = 0`` and the scale's from
    ``t = 1``.  S's point 4 is in policy year 11 at 55, past its loan's first nine years,
    and opens its collateral and its debt equal, as S does, each growing at its own rate
    from there.  The point valued six months after it opens each from its own column,
    8,039.90 and 8,041.89.  The point valued at 593 is in shortfall from ``t = 0``, its
    first shortfall month 0 on the valuation clock.  The point valued at 888, the first
    month at attained age 119, where the table's rate reaches 1, loses every life in
    month 0.  The point issued 25 months on has nothing in force and nothing to do before
    ``t = 25``, and before issue its policy years are -2, -1 and 0, which the guards must
    answer for.

    ``pols_if_at``'s ``"BEF_NB"`` counts the policies before the month's new business, so
    in the issue month it is 0 where ``pols_if`` holds the issued count; ``"BEF_MAT"``
    keeps ``VUL_US_S``'s meaning, that count, since nothing matures; and a timing the
    model does not know is refused by every cell that takes one, rather than answered with
    another value.
