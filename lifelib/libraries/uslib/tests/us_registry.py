"""The model registry, and the locator that resolves it against this library.

Models are located relative to **this library directory**, so the suite runs from a clean
clone with no installation step, and keeps running from a copy made by
``lifelib.create()`` — where it tests *that copy's* models, which is the whole point of
shipping the tests inside the library.

That is why the path here is relative and not :data:`lifelib._dirs.TEMPLATES`: the
canonical locator resolves to the *installed* library, so a copy would silently test
lifelib's pristine models instead of the user's edited ones, and pass while proving
nothing.

:data:`MODELS` is the registry ``test_model_conventions.py`` is parametrized over, so
registering a model here subjects it to the whole house style: it then either conforms or
fails.  The metadata records the projection basis and records that none of them discount.
That last entry is a property of the library, not an omission: every ``technical-notes.md``
specifies *gross liability cash flows* and leaves discounting and reserves to a separate
layer that consumes them.

**The SEC keys.**  USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md puts a ``_SEC`` model beside each ``_S`` one, and eight
metadata keys describe it: three from the plan's D10, two from its D5, one from its R17,
one from its R16 and one from its R14.  ``"twin"`` names the S model an SEC model is
derived from; its presence is what makes
an entry SEC (:func:`is_sec`).  ``"stage"`` is ``"E"`` while an SEC model runs in force at
``t = 0`` but does not yet compile, and ``"EC"`` once it does; the name does not change
with it.  ``"param"`` names the ``Projection`` parameter: ``"point_id"``, the default, or
``"idx"``, the position of a model point in the ``Data`` vectors, which a compiled model
takes as ``basiclife/BasicTerm_SC`` does.  ``"closing_pols_if"`` marks ``SPIA_US_SEC``
alone, whose ``pols_if`` is a closing count, not the count that weights row ``t``.
``"survival_pols_if"`` marks ``DIA_US_SEC`` alone, whose ``pols_if`` is the count on the
books weighted by ``lives_if_last(t)``, the probability that a covered life is alive at
the start of month ``t``, as ``DIA_US_S`` weights its constant count: neither the count
that weights row ``t`` nor a closing count.  And
``"reporting"``, at stage ``"EC"``, names the model's label accessors: the S cells that
return a model point's text, kept for a reader and for the twin identity, which no other
cell calls and which stay Python when the model compiles, beside ``model_point``, the
``result_*`` reports and the ``check_*`` cells.  ``"python_calls"``, at stage ``"EC"``, maps
a ``Projection`` cell to the Python builtins its formula may still call, R16's ``round`` of
a projected amount, which the typing guard's check of the generated C and the static check
of the formulas then admit in that cell alone, and nowhere else; ``WholeLife_US_SEC``'s
dividend is the first.  It names builtins only, by their bare names.  ``"engine"``, at
stage ``"EC"``, names S's cells of float parameters that an SEC model keeps for a reader and
for the twin identity, which no compiled cell calls and which compile with C signatures
and dict caches, their bodies Python, admitted to the typing guard and the static check
as the reporting cells are (R14); one may call another, and none returns a column, as a
label accessor does.  ``MYGA_US_SEC``'s statutory nonforfeiture rate is the first.  It
names too S's cells of no parameter that return a list, a dict or a DataFrame, which no C
type holds, kept for a reader and for the twin identity and called by no compiled cell,
as ``DIA_US_SEC``'s ``qlac_flags`` and premium schedule are (M24).  Read
them through :func:`meta`, which hands out a copy: ``MONTHLY`` is one dict, shared by every
entry that registers it.

``"reporting_columns"``, at stage ``"EC"`` beside ``"reporting"``, says what a label
accessor returns where that is not its point's column of the label's own name, in one of
three shapes: a column, for a label that takes no argument, as ``SPIA_US_SEC``'s
``payment_timing`` returns ``timing``; a dict of argument to column, for a label that
takes one argument, as its ``sex(life)`` returns ``primary_sex`` or ``joint_sex``; or a
pair of a column and a dict of value to label, for a label that returns the column's
value through the dict, a value the dict lacks as it is, as ``DIA_US_SEC``'s
``payout_form`` does.  A label it does not name returns its own column.

**Why :func:`point_keys` exists.**  An ``idx``-parameterized ``Projection`` is indexed by
position, not by table label.  The tables number their points from 1, so a test that
indexes such a model by label is off by one — ``Projection[1]`` is the second point, and the
first is never projected — and then fails at the last label, which lies past the end of
every vector, far from the line that caused it.  So no test indexes ``Projection`` by hand:
:func:`point_keys` gives the keys in table order, for whichever parameter the model takes,
and :func:`projection` turns a key into its ItemSpace.

**Why this is not in `conftest.py`.**  Two libraries now ship in-library suites, and
``conftest.py`` is a name pytest fixes.  Collecting both in one run puts two files called
``conftest`` on ``sys.path``, one wins ``sys.modules``, and every ``from conftest import
LIB`` in *either* suite silently resolves to the other library — a green run against the
wrong models, or the ``FileNotFoundError`` that revealed it.  The registry therefore lives
under a library-unique module name and ``conftest.py`` re-exports it for its fixtures.

ANNUAL = {"grid": "annual", "age_basis": "ANB", "discounted": False}
MONTHLY = {"grid": "monthly", "age_basis": "ANB", "discounted": False}

# ``ANNUAL`` has no members below, and that is **not** the same as saying the library has no
# use for it.  The metadata is a statement about a model rather than about the library: a
# model added or converted to an annual step registers ``ANNUAL`` here, and
# ``test_the_name_carries_the_right_grid_suffix`` then requires its name to end ``_A``.  The
# row and the name move together, which is the point of asserting the suffix from the
# metadata rather than from the folder.

# name -> (path relative to the library root, metadata)
#
# The name is <market short name>_<country>_<grid>: the name the product is actually known
# by (MYGA, RILA, SPIA, ULSG — the same short names the taxonomy tables in the library's
# README use), then US, then _A for an annual step or _S for a monthly one.  The grid
# letters follow lifelib, where annuallife/TradLife_A is the annual-step model and
# basiclife/BasicTerm_S and savings/CashValue_SE are the monthly ones.
#
# This pairing is not derivable from the folder slug — "registered_index_linked_annuity"
# spelled out is unusable and the industry says RILA — so it lives here, and
# test_model_conventions.py asserts name, folder and the model's own _name all agree.
#
# An SEC model takes its twin's name with "EC" after the grid letter, and lives in its
# twin's product directory (USLIB-SEC-PLAN.md D1): E for running in force at t = 0, as
# basiclife/BasicTerm_SE does, C for compiling, as basiclife/BasicTerm_SC does.  The name is
# the family's from the model's first commit, at stage "E" as at "EC", so it never moves
# when the stage does (D2).  Its entry is the twin's metadata plus the SEC keys:
#
#     "Term_US_SEC": ("products/term_life/Term_US_SEC",
#                     {**MONTHLY, "twin": "Term_US_S", "stage": "E"}),
#
# with "param": "idx" and the "reporting" label accessors added at stage "EC", and there
# "python_calls" where a cell keeps a Python builtin, "engine" where it keeps S's cells
# of float parameters, "closing_pols_if": True on
# SPIA_US_SEC alone, and "survival_pols_if": True on DIA_US_SEC alone.  Phase 1 adds them
# one product at a time,
# each directly after its twin and with its INPUT_FILES set below, and Phase 2 moves each
# to stage "EC"; Term_US_SEC, the first, was entered exactly so, and is the first at "EC",
# WholeLife_US_SEC the second, UL_US_SEC the third, VUL_US_SEC the fourth, ULSG_US_SEC the
# fifth, MYGA_US_SEC the sixth, SPIA_US_SEC the seventh, DIA_US_SEC the eighth,
# FIA_US_SEC the ninth and IUL_US_SEC the tenth.

# name -> the exact set of input files a full sweep of the shipped model point table reads.
#
# ``test_model_conventions.py`` asserts this set, not merely that whatever was read was
# read once.  Counting only the files that happen to be read makes the check self-
# fulfilling: a file that stops being read drops out of the counter, and the read-once
# assertion passes over less coverage rather than failing.  Registering the set is what
# turns "each file is read once per model" into a statement about *which* files.
#
# The set is what the **base run** reads, which is not always every CSV in the directory.
# ``VUL_US_S`` ships ``prem_persistency.csv`` and does not read it: ``prem_persistency(t)``
# short-circuits to 1.0 while ``dyn_behavior_on`` is off, which is the default, so only a
# test that switches the behaviour module on reaches the table.  Two files are reached
# late rather than not at all — ``SPIA_US_S`` first reads its mortality table and
# improvement scale at model point 7, where ``mort_basis`` stops being ``"scenario"`` —
# which is why the sweep has to run to the end of the table before this is asserted.
